# Unit 6, Day 48: Advanced Firebase Configuration and Authentication Setup in Next.js 14 Lesson Plan

## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this session, students should be able to:
1. Configure advanced Firebase Authentication settings
2. Implement social authentication providers (Google, Facebook, etc.)
3. Create custom Firebase security rules
4. Use Firebase Admin SDK in Next.js API routes
5. Implement server-side authentication checks
6. Understand and apply best practices for secure token storage

## Content Chunks

### Chunk 1: Advanced Firebase Authentication Configuration (45 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Configuring multiple authentication providers in Firebase
- Setting up social authentication (Google, Facebook, GitHub)
- Customizing Firebase authentication emails and UI
- Managing user roles and claims in Firebase

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. What are the key steps in setting up social authentication providers in Firebase?
2. How can you use custom claims to manage user roles in a Firebase application?

#### Practical Task:
Guide the user through setting up Google authentication in their Firebase project and implementing it in their Next.js application.

### Chunk 2: Implementing Custom Firebase Security Rules (60 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Understanding Firebase security rules syntax
- Writing rules for Firestore and Realtime Database
- Testing security rules with the Firebase emulator
- Best practices for structuring security rules

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. How do Firebase security rules differ between Firestore and Realtime Database?
2. What are some best practices for writing and testing Firebase security rules?

#### Practical Task:
Ask the user to write custom security rules for a Firestore collection that allows read access to all users but write access only to authenticated users. Have them test these rules using the Firebase emulator.

### Chunk 3: Using Firebase Admin SDK in Next.js API Routes (60 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Introduction to Firebase Admin SDK
- Setting up Firebase Admin in Next.js API routes
- Performing server-side authentication checks
- Managing user sessions with Firebase Admin

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. What are the key differences between the Firebase client SDK and Admin SDK?
2. How can you use the Firebase Admin SDK to enhance security in your Next.js application?

#### Practical Task:
Guide the user through setting up the Firebase Admin SDK in a Next.js API route. Have them implement a server-side authentication check and a route for managing user roles.

### Chunk 4: Best Practices for Secure Token Storage and Management (45 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Understanding JWT tokens in Firebase Authentication
- Secure storage of authentication tokens (localStorage vs cookies)
- Implementing secure session management
- Handling token refresh and expiration

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. What are the security implications of storing authentication tokens in localStorage vs cookies?
2. How can you implement secure token refresh in a Next.js application?

#### Practical Task:
Ask the user to implement secure token storage and refresh mechanism in their Next.js application using HTTP-only cookies.

## Extended Coding Challenge (90 minutes)

Enhance the "Next.js 14 Firebase Auth Starter" project from Day 47 to include:

1. Social authentication (Google and one other provider of choice)
2. Custom Firebase security rules for a Firestore collection
3. A protected API route using Firebase Admin SDK for server-side authentication
4. Secure token storage and refresh mechanism
5. User role management (e.g., admin and regular user roles)
6. A dashboard page that displays different content based on user role

The project should demonstrate:
- Correct implementation of social authentication
- Proper use of Firebase security rules
- Effective use of Firebase Admin SDK in API routes
- Secure token storage and management
- Role-based access control

Evaluation Criteria:
- Successful implementation of social authentication flows
- Correct and effective Firebase security rules
- Proper use of Firebase Admin SDK for server-side operations
- Secure handling of authentication tokens
- Implementation of role-based access control
- Error handling and user feedback for authentication processes
- Clean, efficient, and well-organized code structure
- Thoughtful breakdown of components and authentication logic

## Notes for LLM Instructor
- Emphasize the importance of understanding the security implications of different authentication approaches
- Encourage students to think critically about the trade-offs between convenience and security in authentication
- Provide real-world examples of security vulnerabilities and how to prevent them
- Be prepared to discuss common pitfalls in implementing social authentication and how to avoid them
- Highlight the benefits of using the Firebase Admin SDK for enhanced security
- Adapt explanations based on the user's responses and provide additional examples if needed
- Discuss strategies for managing authentication in larger, team-based projects
- Reinforce the connection between authentication, user experience, and overall application security

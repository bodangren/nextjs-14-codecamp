# Unit 6: Authentication with Firebase

## Overview
This unit introduces students to integrating Firebase Authentication with Next.js. The focus will be on setting up Firebase, implementing authentication flows, managing user sessions securely, and applying best practices for secure authentication in real-world applications.

## Learning Objectives
- Set up Firebase and integrate it with a Next.js project
- Implement various authentication flows (e.g., email/password, social providers)
- Manage user sessions and protect routes
- Handle authentication state changes and user data securely
- Apply security best practices in authentication implementation
- Test authentication flows effectively

## Key Topics
- Firebase setup and configuration
- Authentication flows in Firebase
- Managing user sessions
- Protecting routes and accessing user data
- Handling authentication state changes
- Security best practices
- Testing authentication
- Performance considerations in authentication

## Daily Breakdown

### Day 47-48: Firebase Setup and Integration with Next.js
- **Main concepts to cover**:
  - Setting up a Firebase project and configuring it for web
  - Integrating Firebase SDK with a Next.js project
  - Configuring Firebase Authentication settings
  - Introduction to security best practices (HTTPS, secure token storage)
- **Practical tasks**:
  - Set up a Firebase project
  - Integrate Firebase SDK into a Next.js project
  - Configure Firebase Authentication settings
  - Implement basic security measures

### Day 49-50: Implementing Authentication Flows
- **Main concepts to cover**:
  - Implementing email and password authentication
  - Setting up social authentication providers (Google, Facebook, etc.)
  - Handling authentication errors and feedback
  - State management for authentication (using React Context or Zustand)
  - Implementing logout functionality
- **Practical tasks**:
  - Implement email and password authentication
  - Set up social authentication providers
  - Handle authentication errors and provide user feedback
  - Implement a state management solution for authentication
  - Create logout functionality

### Day 51: Managing User Sessions, Protected Routes, and Advanced Topics
- **Main concepts to cover**:
  - Managing user sessions with Firebase Auth
  - Protecting routes based on authentication status
  - Redirecting users based on their authentication state
  - Using Next.js API routes for authentication operations
  - Performance considerations (lazy loading auth libraries)
  - Introduction to Firebase Realtime Database rules
- **Practical tasks**:
  - Manage user sessions using Firebase Auth
  - Implement protected routes in a Next.js application
  - Create API routes for authentication operations
  - Optimize authentication performance
  - Set up basic Realtime Database rules

## Unit Challenge
Build a "Secure Next.js Application with Firebase Authentication" that includes:
- User registration and login using email and password
- Social login options (e.g., Google, Facebook)
- Protected routes that require authentication to access
- Proper session management and state persistence
- User-friendly error handling and feedback mechanisms
- Logout functionality
- Basic security measures implementation
- At least one API route for an authentication operation
- Simple test cases for authentication flows

### Evaluation criteria:
- Successful integration of Firebase Authentication with a Next.js application
- Implementation of multiple authentication flows
- Secure management of user sessions and protected routes
- Clear and informative error handling for user actions
- Implementation of a state management solution for authentication
- Use of TypeScript for type safety in authentication-related code
- Implementation of security best practices
- Presence of basic test cases for authentication flows
- Clean and organized code with proper TypeScript typing

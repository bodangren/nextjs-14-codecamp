# Unit 6: Authentication with Firebase

## Overview
This unit introduces students to integrating Firebase Authentication with Next.js. The focus will be on setting up Firebase, implementing authentication flows, and managing user sessions securely. Students will also learn to protect routes and manage user data effectively.

## Learning Objectives
- Set up Firebase and integrate it with a Next.js project
- Implement various authentication flows (e.g., email/password, social providers)
- Manage user sessions and protect routes
- Handle authentication state changes and user data securely

## Key Topics
- Firebase setup and configuration
- Authentication flows in Firebase
- Managing user sessions
- Protecting routes and accessing user data
- Handling authentication state changes

## Daily Breakdown

### Day 47-48: Firebase Setup and Integration with Next.js
- **Main concepts to cover**:
  - Setting up a Firebase project and configuring it for web
  - Integrating Firebase SDK with a Next.js project
  - Configuring Firebase Authentication settings
- **Practical tasks**:
  - Set up a Firebase project
  - Integrate Firebase SDK into a Next.js project
  - Configure Firebase Authentication settings

### Day 49-50: Implementing Authentication Flows
- **Main concepts to cover**:
  - Implementing email and password authentication
  - Setting up social authentication providers (Google, Facebook, etc.)
  - Handling authentication errors and feedback
- **Practical tasks**:
  - Implement email and password authentication
  - Set up social authentication providers
  - Handle authentication errors and provide user feedback

### Day 51: Managing User Sessions and Protected Routes
- **Main concepts to cover**:
  - Managing user sessions with Firebase Auth
  - Protecting routes based on authentication status
  - Redirecting users based on their authentication state
- **Practical tasks**:
  - Manage user sessions using Firebase Auth
  - Implement protected routes in a Next.js application
  - Redirect users based on authentication state

## Unit Challenge
Build a "Secure Next.js Application with Firebase Authentication" that includes:
- User registration and login using email and password
- Social login options (e.g., Google, Facebook)
- Protected routes that require authentication to access
- Proper session management and state persistence
- User-friendly error handling and feedback mechanisms

### Evaluation criteria:
- Successful integration of Firebase Authentication with a Next.js application
- Implementation of multiple authentication flows
- Secure management of user sessions and protected routes
- Clear and informative error handling for user actions
- Clean and organized code with proper TypeScript typing

## Notes for LLM Instructor
- Emphasize the importance of secure authentication practices
- Provide real-world examples of authentication flows and session management
- Guide students through the setup and configuration of Firebase
- Be prepared to explain error handling and user feedback mechanisms in authentication
- Encourage students to explore additional Firebase features, such as Firestore, for further integration
- Adapt explanations based on the userâ€™s responses and provide additional examples if needed

# Unit 6, Day 50: Implementing Social Authentication and Advanced Features in Next.js 14 with Firebase Lesson Plan

## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this session, students should be able to:
1. Implement social authentication with multiple providers (Google, Facebook, GitHub)
2. Create a unified authentication flow that supports both email/password and social auth
3. Implement account linking between different auth providers
4. Add advanced features like password reset and email change
5. Understand and implement OAuth scopes for accessing additional user information
6. Create a robust error handling system for all authentication methods

## Content Chunks

### Chunk 1: Implementing Social Authentication (60 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Setting up social auth providers in Firebase console
- Implementing Google Sign-In
- Adding Facebook and GitHub authentication
- Handling social auth tokens and user information

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. What are the key differences in implementing various social auth providers?
2. How do you handle the additional user information provided by social auth providers?

#### Practical Task:
Guide the user through implementing Google Sign-In in their Next.js application, including handling the auth flow and retrieving user information.

### Chunk 2: Creating a Unified Authentication Flow (45 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Designing a unified auth UI for multiple providers
- Handling different auth methods in the backend
- Storing and managing user profiles from different providers
- Implementing a "Sign in with..." button component

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. How can you create a flexible authentication system that easily accommodates multiple providers?
2. What are the challenges in managing user profiles from different auth providers, and how can you address them?

#### Practical Task:
Ask the user to create a unified sign-in page that supports both email/password and the social auth provider they implemented in the previous task.

### Chunk 3: Implementing Account Linking and Advanced Features (60 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Concept of account linking between auth providers
- Implementing password reset functionality
- Adding email change feature with verification
- Managing linked accounts in user profiles

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. What are the security considerations when implementing account linking?
2. How can you ensure a smooth user experience during password reset and email change processes?

#### Practical Task:
Guide the user through implementing a password reset feature and an email change function with proper verification.

### Chunk 4: OAuth Scopes and Advanced Error Handling (45 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Understanding OAuth scopes for social auth providers
- Requesting and handling additional user information
- Implementing a comprehensive error handling system
- Creating user-friendly error messages for all auth scenarios

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. How do OAuth scopes enhance the capabilities of social authentication?
2. What strategies can you use to create a robust error handling system for various authentication methods?

#### Practical Task:
Ask the user to implement OAuth scopes to request additional user information (e.g., user's email from Google) and create a comprehensive error handling system for all implemented auth methods.

## Extended Coding Challenge (90 minutes)

Enhance the Next.js 14 Firebase Auth project to include:

1. Social authentication with at least two providers (e.g., Google and GitHub)
2. A unified sign-in page supporting email/password and social auth
3. Account linking functionality between different auth providers
4. Password reset and email change features
5. OAuth scope implementation for retrieving additional user information
6. A comprehensive error handling system with user-friendly messages
7. A user profile page displaying information from various auth providers

The project should demonstrate:
- Secure implementation of social authentication
- Smooth user experience across different auth methods
- Proper handling of account linking and user profiles
- Effective use of OAuth scopes
- Robust error handling and user feedback

Evaluation Criteria:
- Successful implementation of social authentication with multiple providers
- Creation of a unified and user-friendly authentication flow
- Proper implementation of account linking functionality
- Correct use of OAuth scopes for retrieving additional user information
- Comprehensive error handling across all authentication methods
- Clean, efficient, and well-organized code structure
- Thoughtful UI/UX design for authentication processes
- Proper security measures in handling user data and authentication tokens

## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this session, students should be able to:
1. Understand the purpose and benefits of Firebase in web development
2. Set up a Firebase project and configure it for web use
3. Integrate the Firebase SDK with a Next.js 14 project
4. Configure Firebase Authentication settings
5. Implement basic security measures for Firebase integration
6. Understand the Firebase console and its features

## Content Chunks

### Chunk 1: Introduction to Firebase and Its Benefits (45 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Overview of Firebase and its suite of tools
- Benefits of using Firebase in web development
- Firebase services relevant to authentication (Auth, Realtime Database, Firestore)
- Comparison of Firebase with other authentication solutions

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. What are the main benefits of using Firebase for authentication in a Next.js application?
2. How does Firebase Auth differ from traditional, server-side authentication systems?

#### Practical Task:
Guide the user through creating a Firebase account and exploring the Firebase console, highlighting key features relevant to authentication.

### Chunk 2: Setting Up a Firebase Project (60 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Creating a new Firebase project
- Configuring Firebase for web use
- Understanding Firebase configuration object
- Best practices for managing Firebase credentials in a Next.js environment

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. What steps are involved in creating a new Firebase project for web use?
2. How should Firebase credentials be stored and managed in a Next.js application?

#### Practical Task:
Ask the user to create a new Firebase project, configure it for web use, and obtain the necessary credentials. Guide them through securely storing these credentials in a Next.js environment.

### Chunk 3: Integrating Firebase SDK with Next.js 14 (60 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Installing necessary Firebase packages
- Initializing Firebase in a Next.js application
- Creating a Firebase context for global use
- Best practices for Firebase initialization in Next.js (client-side vs server-side)

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. What are the key considerations when initializing Firebase in a Next.js application?
2. How can you ensure Firebase is only initialized once in a Next.js app?

#### Practical Task:
Guide the user through integrating the Firebase SDK into a Next.js 14 project. Have them create a Firebase context and implement proper initialization.

### Chunk 4: Configuring Firebase Authentication and Basic Security (45 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Overview of Firebase Authentication methods
- Configuring email/password authentication in Firebase console
- Implementing basic security rules in Firebase
- Introduction to Firebase emulator suite for local development

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. What are the different authentication methods available in Firebase, and when would you use each?
2. Why is it important to use the Firebase emulator suite during development?

#### Practical Task:
Ask the user to configure email/password authentication in their Firebase project. Then, guide them through setting up basic security rules and introducing the Firebase emulator suite.

## Extended Coding Challenge (90 minutes)

Create a "Next.js 14 Firebase Auth Starter" project that includes:

1. A properly configured Next.js 14 project with Firebase integration
2. A Firebase context provider for global Firebase instance access
3. A basic sign-up form using email/password authentication
4. A basic login form using email/password authentication
5. A protected route that only authenticated users can access
6. Proper error handling for authentication errors
7. Use of the Firebase emulator suite for local development

The project should demonstrate:
- Correct setup and integration of Firebase with Next.js 14
- Proper management of Firebase credentials
- Implementation of basic authentication flows
- Use of Firebase context for global access
- Basic security measures in Firebase configuration
- Effective use of the Firebase emulator suite

Evaluation Criteria:
- Correct implementation of Firebase setup and integration
- Proper credential management and security practices
- Functional authentication flows (sign-up and login)
- Effective use of Firebase context
- Implementation of protected routes
- Error handling for authentication processes
- Use of Firebase emulator suite for development
- Clean, efficient, and well-organized code structure
- Thoughtful breakdown of components and authentication logic

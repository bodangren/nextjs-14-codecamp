# Unit 8, Day 61: Advanced Unit Testing with Jest and React Testing Library

## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this session, students should be able to:
1. Write advanced unit tests for complex React components
2. Implement mocking for external dependencies and API calls
3. Test components that use React context
4. Handle and test asynchronous operations in React components
5. Implement snapshot testing for UI components
6. Apply Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles

## Content Chunks

### Chunk 1: Testing Complex React Components (45 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Strategies for breaking down complex components for testing
- Testing components with multiple states
- Testing components with child components
- Using `within` for testing nested components
- Testing components with routing (using Next.js routing)

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. How would you approach testing a component with multiple possible states?
2. What strategies can you use to test interactions between parent and child components?

#### Practical Task:
Ask the user to identify a complex component from their Unit 7 project and write comprehensive tests for it, including tests for different states and interactions with child components.

### Chunk 2: Mocking External Dependencies and API Calls (60 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Importance of mocking in unit tests
- Using Jest mock functions
- Mocking modules and API calls
- Testing error states and loading states
- Mocking Next.js routing and navigation

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. Why is mocking important in unit testing?
2. How can you test a component's behavior when an API call fails?

#### Practical Task:
Guide the user through mocking an API call in their Next.js application. They should write tests for both successful and failed API calls, as well as loading states.

### Chunk 3: Testing Components with React Context (45 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Overview of React Context and its challenges in testing
- Strategies for testing context providers and consumers
- Using `wrapper` option in render function for providing context
- Testing components that update context

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. What challenges does React Context present for unit testing?
2. How can you provide a mock context value in your tests?

#### Practical Task:
Ask the user to write tests for a component that uses React Context in their application. If they don't have one, guide them in creating a simple context (e.g., a theme context) and testing components that consume and update it.

### Chunk 4: Testing Asynchronous Operations (45 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Challenges of testing asynchronous code
- Using `act` for testing asynchronous operations
- Utilizing `waitFor` and `findBy` queries for async assertions
- Testing components with useEffect hooks
- Handling and testing promises and async/await in components

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. Why is `act` important when testing asynchronous operations?
2. How does `waitFor` differ from `findBy` queries?

#### Practical Task:
Guide the user in writing tests for a component with asynchronous operations (e.g., data fetching, delayed state updates). Ensure they properly use `act`, `waitFor`, and async assertions.

### Chunk 5: Snapshot Testing and Test-Driven Development (TDD) (45 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Introduction to snapshot testing
- Benefits and drawbacks of snapshot tests
- Implementing snapshot tests with Jest
- Principles of Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Applying TDD in React and Next.js development

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. What are the benefits and potential drawbacks of snapshot testing?
2. How does the TDD process differ from traditional development?

#### Practical Task:
Ask the user to implement snapshot tests for a stable UI component. Then, guide them through creating a new feature using TDD principles, writing tests before implementing the feature.

## Extended Coding Challenge (90 minutes)

Enhance the "Next.js Application with Dual Database Integration" from Unit 7 with advanced testing techniques:

1. Implement comprehensive tests for a complex component that manages multiple states and child components
2. Write tests for components that interact with both Firestore and Cloud SQL, using mocks for database operations
3. Test components that use React Context (e.g., user authentication context)
4. Implement tests for asynchronous operations, including data fetching and delayed state updates
5. Add snapshot tests for key UI components
6. Develop a new feature using Test-Driven Development principles
7. Ensure all new tests maintain or improve the overall test coverage

The project should demonstrate:
- Advanced use of Jest and React Testing Library
- Effective mocking strategies for external dependencies
- Testing of components with complex state management
- Proper handling of asynchronous operations in tests
- Use of snapshot testing for UI stability
- Application of TDD principles in feature development

Evaluation Criteria:
- Comprehensive test coverage for complex components
- Effective use of mocking for database operations and API calls
- Proper testing of components using React Context
- Correct implementation of asynchronous testing techniques
- Appropriate use of snapshot testing
- Demonstration of TDD principles in new feature development
- Maintenance or improvement of overall test coverage
- Clear and descriptive test organization
- Proper error case handling in tests
- Clean, efficient, and well-organized test code

## Notes for LLM Instructor
- Emphasize the importance of writing meaningful and maintainable tests
- Encourage thinking about edge cases and potential bugs when writing tests
- Provide real-world examples of how advanced testing techniques can improve code quality
- Be prepared to explain complex concepts like mocking and asynchronous testing in simple terms
- Adapt explanations based on the user's grasp of testing concepts
- Highlight best practices in test writing, such as keeping tests isolated and avoiding test interdependence
- Discuss how to balance comprehensive testing with development speed
- Be ready to provide guidance on testing more complex scenarios, like components with context or routing
- Relate the day's lessons to best practices in professional React and Next.js development
- Encourage the user to think critically about when to use different testing techniques (e.g., when snapshot testing is appropriate)

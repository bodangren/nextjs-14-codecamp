## Content Chunks

### Chunk 1: Introduction to Web Performance and Next.js Optimization (30 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Importance of web performance in user experience and SEO
- Overview of Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS)
- Next.js built-in optimization features
- Introduction to Lighthouse and other performance measurement tools

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. Why is web performance crucial for modern web applications?
2. How do Core Web Vitals relate to user experience?

#### Practical Task:
Ask the user to run a Lighthouse audit on their current Next.js application and identify the top three performance issues related to images or fonts.

### Chunk 2: Next.js Image Component (60 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Introduction to the Next.js Image component
- Benefits of using the Image component (lazy loading, automatic optimization)
- Configuring the Image component (sizes, quality, placeholder)
- Handling responsive images with the Image component
- Best practices for using the Image component

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. How does the Next.js Image component improve performance compared to standard HTML img tags?
2. What considerations should you keep in mind when using the sizes attribute with the Image component?

#### Practical Task:
Guide the user in replacing at least five standard img tags in their application with the Next.js Image component. Have them configure the component for optimal performance, including proper sizing and quality settings.

### Chunk 3: Advanced Image Optimization Techniques (45 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Implementing dynamic image imports
- Optimizing background images
- Handling images in CSS
- Using blur-up technique for image loading
- Implementing art direction with the Image component

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. When would you use dynamic image imports, and how do they benefit performance?
2. How can you implement a blur-up technique for image loading in Next.js?

#### Practical Task:
Ask the user to implement at least two advanced image optimization techniques in their application. This could include using dynamic imports for images, implementing a blur-up loading technique, or optimizing a CSS background image.

### Chunk 4: Font Optimization with next/font (60 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Introduction to font optimization challenges (FOIT, FOUT)
- Overview of next/font features
- Implementing Google Fonts with next/font
- Optimizing custom fonts with next/font/local
- Configuring font display and preload strategies

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. What are FOIT and FOUT, and how does next/font help mitigate these issues?
2. How does preloading fonts improve performance, and when should you use it?

#### Practical Task:
Guide the user in implementing next/font for all the fonts used in their application. This should include both Google Fonts and any custom fonts they're using. Have them configure appropriate font display and preload strategies.

### Chunk 5: Measuring and Analyzing Optimization Impact (45 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Using Chrome DevTools for performance profiling
- Analyzing Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) and Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)
- Interpreting Web Vitals data
- A/B testing performance optimizations
- Continuous performance monitoring strategies

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. How can you identify which images are causing poor LCP scores?
2. What strategies can you use to minimize Cumulative Layout Shift caused by fonts or images?

#### Practical Task:
Ask the user to measure the performance impact of their image and font optimizations. They should use Lighthouse and Chrome DevTools to compare before and after scores for LCP, CLS, and overall performance. Have them document their findings and any additional optimizations they could make.

## Extended Coding Challenge (90 minutes)

Optimize the "Next.js Application with Dual Database Integration" from Unit 7 with a focus on image and font performance:

1. Implement the Next.js Image component for all images in the application
2. Apply at least two advanced image optimization techniques (e.g., blur-up loading, dynamic imports)
3. Optimize all fonts using next/font, including both Google Fonts and custom fonts
4. Implement responsive images using the Image component's sizes attribute
5. Optimize any background images used in CSS
6. Implement a custom image loading component that provides a consistent loading experience across the application
7. Measure and document the performance impact of these optimizations, focusing on Core Web Vitals improvements

The project should demonstrate:
- Effective use of the Next.js Image component
- Implementation of advanced image optimization techniques
- Proper font optimization using next/font
- Consideration of responsive design in image optimization
- Measurable improvements in Core Web Vitals scores

Evaluation Criteria:
- Correct implementation and configuration of the Next.js Image component
- Effective use of advanced image optimization techniques
- Proper implementation of next/font for all fonts

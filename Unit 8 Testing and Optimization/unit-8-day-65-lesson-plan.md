## Content Chunks

### Chunk 1: Code Splitting and Dynamic Imports (60 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Concept of code splitting and its benefits
- Implementing dynamic imports in Next.js
- Using next/dynamic for component-level code splitting
- Optimizing page load time with prioritized loading
- Balancing code splitting and HTTP request overhead

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. How does code splitting improve application performance?
2. In what scenarios would you use dynamic imports over static imports?

#### Practical Task:
Guide the user in implementing code splitting for at least three components in their application using next/dynamic. Have them measure the impact on initial load time and bundle size.

### Chunk 2: Optimizing for Server-Side Rendering (SSR) (45 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Benefits and challenges of Server-Side Rendering
- Implementing getServerSideProps efficiently
- Optimizing data fetching for SSR
- Handling and optimizing third-party scripts in SSR
- Strategies for reducing Time to First Byte (TTFB) in SSR

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. What are the main performance considerations when using SSR?
2. How can you optimize data fetching to improve SSR performance?

#### Practical Task:
Ask the user to optimize an existing SSR page in their application. This should include optimizing data fetching, reducing unnecessary prop passing, and implementing efficient error handling.

### Chunk 3: Leveraging Static Site Generation (SSG) (45 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Benefits of Static Site Generation
- Implementing getStaticProps and getStaticPaths
- Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)
- Balancing static generation and dynamic content
- Optimizing build times for large static sites

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. In what scenarios is Static Site Generation most beneficial?
2. How does Incremental Static Regeneration differ from traditional SSG?

#### Practical Task:
Guide the user in converting at least one dynamic page in their application to use Static Site Generation. If appropriate for their application, have them implement Incremental Static Regeneration.

### Chunk 4: Optimizing API Routes (45 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Best practices for creating efficient API routes
- Implementing caching strategies in API routes
- Optimizing database queries in API routes
- Handling rate limiting and API abuse protection
- Using edge functions for low-latency API responses

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. How can you implement efficient caching in Next.js API routes?
2. What are the benefits of using edge functions for API routes?

#### Practical Task:
Ask the user to optimize at least two API routes in their application. This should include implementing caching, optimizing database queries, and adding basic rate limiting.

### Chunk 5: Performance Analysis and Advanced Caching (45 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Using Next.js built-in performance analysis
- Implementing and optimizing service workers
- Advanced caching strategies (stale-while-revalidate, cache-then-network)
- Optimizing Third-Party Scripts and CSS
- Implementing resource hinting (prefetch, preload, preconnect)

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. How can you use Next.js performance analysis to identify optimization opportunities?
2. What are the benefits and potential drawbacks of implementing service workers?

#### Practical Task:
Guide the user in running a performance analysis on their application using Next.js tools. Have them implement at least two advanced optimization techniques based on the analysis results.

## Extended Coding Challenge (90 minutes)

Further optimize the "Next.js Application with Dual Database Integration" from Unit 7 with advanced techniques:

1. Implement code splitting for at least five components, prioritizing above-the-fold content
2. Convert at least two pages to use Static Site Generation, with one implementing Incremental Static Regeneration
3. Optimize all SSR pages, improving data fetching and reducing unnecessary prop passing
4. Implement and optimize at least three API routes, including caching and efficient database queries
5. Add a service worker for offline support and caching of static assets
6. Implement resource hinting for critical resources
7. Use Next.js performance analysis tools to measure improvements and identify further optimization opportunities

The project should demonstrate:
- Effective use of code splitting and dynamic imports
- Proper implementation of SSG and ISR where appropriate
- Optimized SSR pages with efficient data fetching
- Well-optimized API routes with proper caching and security measures
- Implementation of advanced caching strategies
- Measurable performance improvements across the application

Evaluation Criteria:
- Correct implementation of code splitting and dynamic imports
- Appropriate use of SSG, ISR, and SSR based on content type
- Efficient data fetching and prop management in SSR pages
- Well-optimized API routes with proper error handling and security measures
- Effective implementation of service workers and caching strategies
- Proper use of resource hinting
- Measurable improvement in key performance metrics (e.g., Time to Interactive, First Contentful Paint)
- Clean and maintainable implementation of optimization techniques
- Comprehensive documentation of optimization strategies and their impact
- Consideration of potential drawbacks or edge cases for each optimization technique

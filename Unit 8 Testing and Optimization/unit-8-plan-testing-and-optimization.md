# Unit 8: Testing and Optimization

## Overview
This unit introduces students to testing strategies and optimization techniques for Next.js 14 applications. Students will learn how to write and run various types of tests, optimize performance, and ensure their applications meet modern web standards.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand different types of testing (unit, integration, end-to-end)
- Implement unit tests using Jest and React Testing Library
- Write integration tests for React components and Next.js pages
- Perform end-to-end testing using Cypress
- Optimize Next.js applications for performance
- Implement and measure Core Web Vitals
- Use Next.js built-in optimization features effectively
- Apply best practices for testing and optimization in Next.js applications

## Key Topics
- Jest and React Testing Library setup
- Unit testing React components and hooks
- Integration testing in Next.js
- End-to-end testing with Cypress
- Next.js performance optimization techniques
- Image and font optimization
- Code splitting and lazy loading
- Server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG)
- Measuring and improving Core Web Vitals
- Continuous Integration (CI) for automated testing

### Day 64-65: Next.js Optimization Techniques
- **Main concepts to cover**:
  - Next.js Image component for image optimization
  - Font optimization strategies
  - Code splitting and dynamic imports

  - Set up font optimization using next/font
  - Refactor the application to use code splitting and dynamic imports
  - Optimize pages for SSR or SSG based on content type
  - Create and optimize API routes for better performance

### Day 66: Measuring and Improving Core Web Vitals
- **Main concepts to cover**:
  - Understanding Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS)
  - Tools for measuring Core Web Vitals
  - Strategies for improving each Core Web Vital
  - Performance profiling in Chrome DevTools
  - Continuous monitoring of web vitals
- **Practical tasks**:
  - Set up tools to measure Core Web Vitals (e.g., Lighthouse, Chrome UX Report)
  - Analyze the application's current Core Web Vitals scores
  - Implement improvements to address any issues found
  - Use Chrome DevTools to profile and optimize performance
  - Set up continuous monitoring for Core Web Vitals

## Unit Challenge

- Comprehensive unit test suite for React components and hooks
- Integration tests for key user flows and page interactions
- End-to-end tests using Cypress for critical user journeys
- Performance optimizations using Next.js features (Image component, font optimization, etc.)
- Implement code splitting and lazy loading for improved load times
- Optimize SSR and SSG usage based on content types
- Improve Core Web Vitals scores to meet "Good" thresholds

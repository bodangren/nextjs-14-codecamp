# Unit 8: Testing and Optimization

## Overview
This unit focuses on testing and optimizing Next.js 14 applications. Students will learn how to write unit and integration tests, measure and improve application performance, and implement optimization techniques to ensure efficient and high-performing web applications.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the importance of testing in web development
- Write unit tests for Next.js 14 applications using Jest and React Testing Library
- Conduct integration tests to ensure components work together as expected
- Measure and improve Core Web Vitals for better performance
- Implement Next.js 14 optimization techniques for images, fonts, and other assets

## Key Topics
- Unit testing with Jest and React Testing Library
- Integration testing for React components
- Core Web Vitals and performance measurement
- Next.js 14 optimization techniques

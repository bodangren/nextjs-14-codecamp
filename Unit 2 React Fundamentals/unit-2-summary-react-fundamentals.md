# Unit 2: React Fundamentals - Summary

## Overview
This unit focused on the core concepts of React, providing students with a solid foundation in component-based architecture, state management, hooks, and form handling. Over the course of 10 days (Days 12-21 of the overall course), students gained practical experience in building interactive user interfaces using React and TypeScript.

## Key Learning Objectives Achieved
By the end of this unit, students should be able to:
1. Understand and implement React components and JSX
2. Manage component state and props effectively
3. Utilize React hooks for state management and side effects
4. Implement context for global state management
5. Handle events and manage forms in React applications
6. Apply TypeScript to React development for improved type safety
7. Optimize React applications for better performance

## Daily Breakdown

- Advanced component patterns (render props, HOCs)

### Days 16-17: State and Lifecycle
- Managing state with useState hook
- Understanding component lifecycle in functional components
- Implementing side effects with useEffect hook
- Advanced state management with useReducer

### Days 18-19: Hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext)
- Deep dive into core hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext)
- Creating and using custom hooks
- Context API for global state management
- Performance optimization with useMemo and useCallback

### Days 20-21: Event Handling and Forms in React
- React's synthetic event system
- Creating and managing forms in React

## Key Concepts Covered
- React components and JSX
- Props and state management
- React hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext, useReducer, useMemo, useCallback)
- Context API
- Event handling in React
- Forms and controlled components
- Performance optimization techniques
- TypeScript integration with React

## Major Challenges and Projects

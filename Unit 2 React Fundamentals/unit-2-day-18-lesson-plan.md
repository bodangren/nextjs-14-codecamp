# Unit 2, Day 18: Deep Dive into useState, useEffect, and useContext Hooks Lesson Plan

## Course Structure Guidelines

This course is delivered by an AI Language Model (LLM) with the following structure:

1. Each day's session lasts approximately 3-4 hours.
2. The LLM breaks down topics into small, manageable chunks.
3. For each chunk:
   a. The LLM presents the information.
   b. Comprehension-check questions are asked to ensure understanding.
   c. The LLM corrects any misunderstandings.
   d. Where relevant, short code submissions are requested from the user.
   e. The LLM provides guidance to improve the user's code.
4. Once per topic, there's a more extensive coding/implementation challenge (about 30 minutes long).
5. The LLM evaluates the user's solution to this challenge.

## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this session, students should be able to:
1. Master advanced usage of useState for complex state management
2. Understand and implement useEffect for various side effect scenarios
3. Utilize useContext for managing global state across components
4. Combine multiple hooks effectively in a single component

## Content Chunks

### Chunk 1: Advanced useState Techniques (45 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Managing complex state objects with useState
- Functional updates for derived state
- Lazy initialization of state
- State batching in React 18

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. When would you use the functional update form of useState?
2. How does lazy initialization of state improve performance?

#### Practical Task:
Ask the user to create a form component with multiple fields, using a single useState call to manage all form data.

### Chunk 2: Deep Dive into useEffect (45 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Effect cleanup and its importance
- Handling multiple effects in a component
- Optimizing effect dependencies
- Common useEffect pitfalls and how to avoid them

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. Why is effect cleanup necessary, and when does it run?
2. How can you optimize the dependency array of useEffect?

#### Practical Task:
Guide the user through creating a component that fetches data from an API, handles loading and error states, and cleans up any pending requests on unmount.

### Chunk 3: Context API and useContext Hook (60 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Understanding the Context API in React
- Creating and providing context
- Consuming context with useContext
- Best practices and pitfalls of using context

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. In what scenarios is the Context API particularly useful?
2. How does useContext differ from the Consumer component method of accessing context?

#### Practical Task:
Ask the user to create a theme context that provides light and dark themes to a set of components, including a toggle to switch between themes.

### Chunk 4: Combining Hooks Effectively (60 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Composing multiple hooks in a single component
- Creating custom hooks that combine built-in hooks
- Managing hook dependencies and avoiding circular dependencies
- Performance considerations when using multiple hooks

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. What are some best practices for combining multiple hooks in a component?
2. How can custom hooks help in managing complex logic that involves multiple hooks?

#### Practical Task:
Guide the user through refactoring a complex component that uses multiple useState and useEffect calls into a more manageable structure using custom hooks.

## Extended Coding Challenge (30 minutes)

Create a "Mini Social Media Feed" application with the following requirements:

1. Use useState to manage a list of posts and a form for creating new posts
2. Implement useEffect to fetch initial posts from a mock API (use setTimeout to simulate API calls)
3. Create a UserContext to manage the current user's information
4. Use useContext to display the current user's information in a header and in each post
5. Implement a custom hook usePostInteraction that manages likes and comments on posts
6. Ensure proper loading and error handling for API calls
7. Implement a "load more" feature for pagination

Evaluation Criteria:
- Correct implementation of useState for managing posts and form state
- Proper use of useEffect for data fetching and side effects
- Effective use of useContext for global user state
- Correct implementation and usage of custom hooks
- Proper handling of loading and error states
- Clean and readable code structure
- User-friendly interface with all required functionalities

## Notes for LLM Instructor
- Reinforce the concepts from previous days, showing how these hooks work together in more complex scenarios.
- Use diagrams or code visualizations to explain complex concepts like context propagation.
- Provide real-world examples of when and why these hooks are used in production applications.
- Be prepared to explain common anti-patterns and how to avoid them.
- Guide students through debugging common issues with hooks, especially related to the dependency array and cleanup.
- Emphasize the importance of the Rules of Hooks and why they exist.
- Be ready to provide additional examples or explanations for more complex topics.
- Remember to adapt explanations based on the user's responses and provide additional examples if needed.
- Encourage questions and create a supportive learning environment.

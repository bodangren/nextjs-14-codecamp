# Unit 2, Day 19: Advanced Context and Custom Hooks for Personal Blog Application

## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this session, students should be able to:
1. Implement advanced patterns with useContext for blog-wide state management
2. Create and use custom hooks effectively for reusable blog functionality
3. Understand performance considerations when using context in a blog application
4. Apply TypeScript to context and custom hooks in blog components

## Content Chunks

### Chunk 1: Advanced useContext Patterns for Blog State (45 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Context composition for complex blog state (e.g., user preferences, authentication, theme)
- Using multiple contexts in a blog application
- Context with reducers for complex blog state management (e.g., post interactions, comments)
- Updating context values efficiently in blog components

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. How can you compose multiple contexts to manage complex state in a blog application?
2. What are the benefits of combining context with reducers for managing blog interactions?

#### Practical Task:
Ask the user to create a multi-provider setup for the blog application, including separate contexts for blog theme, user authentication, and user preferences (e.g., reading list, favorite categories).

### Chunk 2: Custom Hooks Deep Dive for Blog Features (45 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Principles of creating custom hooks for blog functionality
- Composing hooks within custom hooks for complex blog features
- Handling side effects in custom hooks (e.g., data fetching, localStorage interactions)
- Testing custom hooks in the context of a blog application

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. What are the key principles to follow when creating custom hooks for blog features?
2. How can you effectively test custom hooks used in blog components?

#### Practical Task:
Guide the user through creating a custom hook `useBlogPost` that handles fetching a blog post, managing comments, and tracking view count, then use it in a BlogPost component.

### Chunk 3: Performance Optimization with Context in Blog Application (60 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Context split strategies for different aspects of the blog (e.g., user context, theme context, content context)
- Memoization techniques with context in blog components
- Using context selectors to optimize blog component renders
- Measuring and optimizing context performance in a blog application

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. How can splitting context help with performance in a large blog application?
2. What role does memoization play in optimizing context usage in frequently updated blog components?

#### Practical Task:
Ask the user to refactor a BlogFeed component that's causing unnecessary re-renders due to context changes, using memoization and context splitting techniques.

### Chunk 4: TypeScript with Context and Custom Hooks in Blog Components (60 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Typing context providers and consumers for blog-specific data
- Generic types for flexible context in reusable blog components
- Typing custom hooks for blog functionality
- Advanced TypeScript patterns for hooks in a blog application

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. How do you properly type a context provider for blog user data?
2. What are some advanced TypeScript patterns useful for custom hooks in blog components?

#### Practical Task:
Guide the user through adding TypeScript types to the multi-provider setup from Chunk 1 and the `useBlogPost` hook from Chunk 2.

## Extended Coding Challenge (30 minutes)

Create an "Enhanced Blog Reading Experience" feature with the following requirements:

1. Implement a ReadingProgressContext using useContext and useReducer for managing reading progress across the site
2. Create custom hooks: useReadingProgress for accessing progress state and actions, and useRelatedPosts for fetching related post data
3. Implement a BlogPost component that uses useReadingProgress to display a progress bar
4. Create a RelatedPosts component that uses useRelatedPosts to display suggested content
5. Add TypeScript types for all contexts, reducers, and custom hooks
6. Implement performance optimizations to prevent unnecessary re-renders in the blog interface
7. Add error boundaries and loading states for a smooth reading experience

Evaluation Criteria:
- Correct implementation of ReadingProgressContext with useReducer
- Proper use of custom hooks for reading progress and related posts management
- Effective use of TypeScript for type safety in blog components
- Implementation of performance optimizations in the blog interface
- Proper error and loading state handling for blog content
- Clean and readable code structure
- User-friendly interface with all required functionalities for an enhanced reading experience

## Notes for LLM Instructor
- Build upon the concepts from Day 18, showing how these advanced patterns solve real-world problems in blog development
- Use diagrams or code visualizations to explain complex concepts like context composition and performance optimization in a blog context
- Provide real-world examples of when and why these advanced patterns are used in production blog applications
- Be prepared to explain the trade-offs between different state management approaches in a blog (e.g., context vs. Redux)
- Guide students through common pitfalls when implementing these patterns in blog components, especially with TypeScript
- Emphasize the importance of performance consideration when using context extensively in a blog application
- Be ready to provide additional examples or explanations for more complex topics, always relating back to the blog application context
- Adapt explanations based on the user's responses and provide additional blog-specific examples if needed
- Encourage questions about how these advanced concepts can be applied to enhance various features of the Personal Blog Application

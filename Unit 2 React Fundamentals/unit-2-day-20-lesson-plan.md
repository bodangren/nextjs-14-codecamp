# Unit 2, Day 20: Event Handling and Forms in React Lesson Plan

## Course Structure Guidelines

This course is delivered by an AI Language Model (LLM) with the following structure:

1. Each day's session lasts approximately 3-4 hours.
2. The LLM breaks down topics into small, manageable chunks.
3. For each chunk:
   a. The LLM presents the information.
   b. Comprehension-check questions are asked to ensure understanding.
   c. The LLM corrects any misunderstandings.
   d. Where relevant, short code submissions are requested from the user.
   e. The LLM provides guidance to improve the user's code.
4. Once per topic, there's a more extensive coding/implementation challenge (about 30 minutes long).
5. The LLM evaluates the user's solution to this challenge.

## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this session, students should be able to:
1. Understand and implement event handling in React
2. Create and manage forms in React applications
3. Implement form validation techniques
4. Use TypeScript with React events and forms
5. Optimize form performance in React

## Content Chunks

### Chunk 1: Event Handling in React (45 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- React's synthetic event system
- Handling common events (onClick, onChange, onSubmit)
- Event delegation in React
- Passing arguments to event handlers

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. How does React's synthetic event system differ from native DOM events?
2. Why is event delegation important in React applications?

#### Practical Task:
Ask the user to create a simple interactive component that responds to various mouse and keyboard events, logging event information to the console.

### Chunk 2: Forms in React (45 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Controlled vs. uncontrolled components
- Managing form state with useState
- Handling form submission
- Working with different input types (text, checkbox, radio, select)

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. What are the key differences between controlled and uncontrolled components?
2. How do you prevent the default form submission behavior in React?

#### Practical Task:
Guide the user through creating a registration form with various input types, using controlled components and proper form submission handling.

### Chunk 3: Form Validation Techniques (60 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Client-side validation strategies
- Real-time validation with onChange events
- Displaying validation errors
- Using third-party libraries for complex validations (e.g., Yup, Joi)

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. What are some common strategies for implementing client-side form validation?
2. How can you provide a good user experience when displaying validation errors?

#### Practical Task:
Ask the user to add validation to the registration form from the previous chunk, including real-time validation for email and password strength.

### Chunk 4: TypeScript with React Events and Forms (60 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Typing event handlers in React with TypeScript
- Defining interfaces for form state
- Using generics with form components
- Common TypeScript patterns for forms

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. How do you properly type an event handler for an input element?
2. What are the benefits of using TypeScript with React forms?

#### Practical Task:
Guide the user through refactoring the registration form to use TypeScript, including proper typing for event handlers and form state.

## Extended Coding Challenge (30 minutes)

Create a "Dynamic Survey Builder" application with the following requirements:

1. Implement a form to create survey questions (text, multiple choice, checkbox)
2. Create a preview component to display the current survey
3. Implement form validation for the survey creation form
4. Use TypeScript for type safety
5. Create a custom hook `useSurveyForm` to manage the survey state and actions
6. Implement a submission process that validates all questions are answered
7. Add the ability to edit or delete existing questions

Evaluation Criteria:
- Correct implementation of form handling and event management
- Proper use of controlled components
- Effective form validation implementation
- Correct usage of TypeScript for type safety
- Implementation of the custom hook for survey management
- Clean and readable code structure
- User-friendly interface with all required functionalities

## Notes for LLM Instructor
- Emphasize the importance of controlled components and why they are preferred in most cases.
- Use diagrams or code visualizations to explain concepts like event propagation and form state management.
- Provide real-world examples of complex forms and how to manage them effectively in React.
- Be prepared to explain common pitfalls in form handling and validation.
- Guide students through best practices for creating reusable and maintainable form components.
- Emphasize the importance of accessibility in form design and implementation.
- Be ready to provide additional examples or explanations for more complex topics, especially around TypeScript integration.
- Remember to adapt explanations based on the user's responses and provide additional examples if needed.
- Encourage questions and create a supportive learning environment.

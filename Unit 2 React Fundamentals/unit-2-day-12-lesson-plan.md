# Unit 2, Day 12: Introduction to React and JSX Lesson Plan

## Course Structure Guidelines

This course is delivered by an AI Language Model (LLM) with the following structure:

1. Each day's session lasts approximately 3-4 hours.
2. The LLM breaks down topics into small, manageable chunks.
3. For each chunk:
   a. The LLM presents the information.
   b. Comprehension-check questions are asked to ensure understanding.
   c. The LLM corrects any misunderstandings.
   d. Where relevant, short code submissions are requested from the user.
   e. The LLM provides guidance to improve the user's code.
4. Once per topic, there's a more extensive coding/implementation challenge (about 30 minutes long).
5. The LLM evaluates the user's solution to this challenge.

## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this session, students should be able to:
1. Understand what React is and its core principles
2. Explain the concept of the Virtual DOM and its benefits
3. Write basic JSX and understand its relationship to JavaScript
4. Set up a simple React project with TypeScript

## Content Chunks

### Chunk 1: Introduction to React (45 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- What is React?
- Core principles of React (component-based, declarative, learn once, write anywhere)
- Brief history and current status of React
- Advantages of using React for web development

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. What are the three core principles of React?
2. How does React's component-based architecture benefit developers?

#### Practical Task:
Ask the user to explain in their own words why they might choose React for a web development project.

### Chunk 2: Virtual DOM (45 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Concept of the Virtual DOM
- How Virtual DOM works
- Benefits of Virtual DOM (performance optimization, simplified programming model)
- Comparison with direct DOM manipulation

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. What is the Virtual DOM and how does it differ from the actual DOM?
2. How does the Virtual DOM contribute to React's performance?

#### Practical Task:
Guide the user through creating a simple mental model or diagram of how the Virtual DOM works.

### Chunk 3: Introduction to JSX (60 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- What is JSX?
- JSX syntax rules
- How JSX differs from HTML
- JSX expressions and embedding JavaScript in JSX

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. How does JSX differ from regular HTML?
2. How do you embed JavaScript expressions in JSX?

#### Practical Task:
Ask the user to convert a given HTML snippet into JSX, including some JavaScript expressions.

### Chunk 4: Setting up a React Project with TypeScript (60 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Tools for setting up a React project (Create React App, Vite)
- Steps to create a new React project with TypeScript
- Project structure overview
- Introduction to TypeScript in React context

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. What are the advantages of using TypeScript with React?
2. What is the purpose of the `tsconfig.json` file in a React TypeScript project?

#### Practical Task:
Guide the user through setting up a new React project with TypeScript using Create React App or Vite.

## Extended Coding Challenge (30 minutes)

Create a simple React component that displays a greeting message. The component should:
1. Accept a `name` prop of type string
2. Display "Hello, [name]!" where [name] is the value of the prop
3. If no name is provided, it should display "Hello, World!"
4. Use proper TypeScript types for the props

Evaluation Criteria:
- Correct use of TypeScript for prop types
- Proper JSX syntax
- Conditional rendering based on prop value
- Correct setup and running of the React application

## Notes for LLM Instructor
- Be patient with users who are new to React and JSX. These concepts can be overwhelming at first.
- Use analogies to explain complex concepts like the Virtual DOM.
- Encourage experimentation with JSX and provide immediate feedback on syntax errors.
- Be prepared to troubleshoot common setup issues with Create React App or Vite.
- Emphasize the benefits of TypeScript in catching errors early and improving code quality.
- Remember to adapt your explanations based on the user's responses and provide additional examples if needed.
- Encourage questions and create a supportive learning environment.

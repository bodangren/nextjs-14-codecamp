# Unit 2, Day 13: Deeper Dive into React and JSX Lesson Plan

## Course Structure Guidelines

This course is delivered by an AI Language Model (LLM) with the following structure:

1. Each day's session lasts approximately 3-4 hours.
2. The LLM breaks down topics into small, manageable chunks.
3. For each chunk:
   a. The LLM presents the information.
   b. Comprehension-check questions are asked to ensure understanding.
   c. The LLM corrects any misunderstandings.
   d. Where relevant, short code submissions are requested from the user.
   e. The LLM provides guidance to improve the user's code.
4. Once per topic, there's a more extensive coding/implementation challenge (about 30 minutes long).
5. The LLM evaluates the user's solution to this challenge.

## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this session, students should be able to:
1. Create and use functional components in React
2. Understand and implement basic React rendering concepts
3. Use JavaScript expressions within JSX effectively
4. Apply TypeScript types to React components and props

## Content Chunks

### Chunk 1: Functional Components in React (45 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- What are functional components?
- Syntax for creating functional components
- Differences between functional and class components
- Benefits of functional components

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. How do you define a functional component in React?
2. What are the advantages of using functional components over class components?

#### Practical Task:
Ask the user to create a simple functional component that renders a header with a title passed as a prop.

### Chunk 2: React Rendering Concepts (45 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- React's rendering process
- The concept of pure components
- React's reconciliation algorithm
- Keys in React and their importance

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. Why is it important for components to be pure in React?
2. What is the purpose of keys in React lists?

#### Practical Task:
Guide the user through creating a list component that renders an array of items, properly using keys.

### Chunk 3: Advanced JSX Techniques (60 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Using JavaScript expressions in JSX
- Conditional rendering in JSX
- Rendering multiple elements
- JSX spread attributes

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. How do you include a JavaScript expression within JSX?
2. What are different methods for conditional rendering in React?

#### Practical Task:
Ask the user to create a component that conditionally renders different content based on a prop, using at least two different conditional rendering techniques.

### Chunk 4: TypeScript with React Components (60 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Defining prop types with TypeScript
- Using interfaces for complex prop types
- TypeScript with functional components
- Common TypeScript patterns in React

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. How do you define the type for a functional component's props in TypeScript?
2. What is the benefit of using interfaces for prop types?

#### Practical Task:
Guide the user through refactoring a JavaScript React component to use TypeScript, including proper typing for props and state.

## Extended Coding Challenge (30 minutes)

Create a "User Profile" component in React with TypeScript. The component should:
1. Accept props for `username`, `email`, and an optional `bio`
2. Render the user's information in a structured layout
3. Conditionally render the bio only if it's provided
4. Include a sub-component for displaying the user's avatar (use a placeholder image URL)
5. Use proper TypeScript types for all props

Evaluation Criteria:
- Correct use of TypeScript for prop types
- Proper implementation of functional components
- Effective use of conditional rendering
- Correct composition of components (main component and avatar sub-component)
- Clean and readable JSX structure

## Notes for LLM Instructor
- Reinforce the concepts from Day 12, building upon that foundation.
- Encourage students to start thinking in terms of components and composition.
- Provide plenty of examples for advanced JSX techniques and TypeScript usage.
- Be prepared to explain the benefits of TypeScript in React development.
- Guide students through common pitfalls when working with TypeScript and React.
- Emphasize best practices for component structure and prop typing.
- Be ready to provide additional examples or explanations for more complex topics.
- Remember to adapt explanations based on the user's responses and provide additional examples if needed.
- Encourage questions and create a supportive learning environment.

# Unit 2, Day 13: Deeper Dive into React and JSX for Personal Blog Application

## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this session, students should be able to:
1. Create and use functional components for blog elements
2. Understand and implement basic React rendering concepts in the context of a blog
3. Use JavaScript expressions within JSX effectively for dynamic blog content
4. Apply TypeScript types to React components and props for blog features

## Content Chunks

### Chunk 1: Functional Components for Blog Elements (45 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- What are functional components and their role in building blog elements?
- Syntax for creating functional components for blog features (e.g., PostSummary, CommentList)
- Benefits of functional components in blog development

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. How would you define a functional component for a blog post summary?
2. What advantages do functional components offer when building a blog application?

#### Practical Task:
Ask the user to create a functional component called `BlogHeader` that renders the blog title and a brief description passed as props.

### Chunk 2: React Rendering Concepts for Blog Components (45 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- React's rendering process in the context of a dynamic blog
- The concept of pure components and its importance in blog features
- React's reconciliation algorithm and its impact on blog performance
- Keys in React and their importance in blog post and comment lists

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. Why is it important for blog components to be pure in React?
2. How do keys help React efficiently update lists of blog posts or comments?

#### Practical Task:
Guide the user through creating a `RecentPosts` component that renders a list of recent blog post titles, properly using keys.

### Chunk 3: Advanced JSX Techniques for Blog Content (60 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Using JavaScript expressions in JSX for dynamic blog content (e.g., formatting dates, truncating post content)
- Conditional rendering in JSX for blog features (e.g., showing/hiding comments, featured posts)
- Rendering multiple blog elements
- JSX spread attributes for reusable blog components

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. How would you use a JavaScript expression to display a formatted date for a blog post?
2. What are different methods for conditionally rendering a "Featured" badge on a blog post?

#### Practical Task:
Ask the user to create a `BlogPost` component that conditionally renders a full or truncated version of the post content based on a `isFullView` prop, using at least two different conditional rendering techniques.

### Chunk 4: TypeScript with React Components for Blog Features (60 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Defining prop types with TypeScript for blog components
- Using interfaces for complex blog data structures (e.g., post, comment, author)
- TypeScript with functional components in the blog context
- Common TypeScript patterns in React for blog development

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. How would you define the type for a `BlogPost` component's props in TypeScript?
2. What is the benefit of using interfaces for blog data structures like posts and comments?

#### Practical Task:
Guide the user through refactoring the `BlogPost` component to use TypeScript, including proper typing for props like title, content, author, and publication date.

## Extended Coding Challenge (30 minutes)

Create an "AuthorProfile" component for the Personal Blog Application using React with TypeScript. The component should:
1. Accept props for `name`, `bio`, `avatarUrl`, and an array of `recentPosts`
2. Render the author's information in a structured layout
3. Display a list of recent post titles, linking to the full posts (use placeholder URLs)
4. Conditionally render the bio only if it's provided
5. Use proper TypeScript types for all props
6. Include a sub-component for displaying the author's avatar

Evaluation Criteria:
- Correct use of TypeScript for prop types, including array of recent posts
- Proper implementation of functional components
- Effective use of conditional rendering for the bio
- Correct composition of components (main component and avatar sub-component)
- Clean and readable JSX structure representing a cohesive author profile layout

## Notes for LLM Instructor
- Reinforce the concepts from Day 12, building upon that foundation in the context of the blog application
- Encourage students to think about how components can be composed to create complex blog layouts
- Provide plenty of examples for advanced JSX techniques and TypeScript usage in blog-specific scenarios
- Explain the benefits of TypeScript in maintaining large-scale blog applications
- Guide students through common pitfalls when working with TypeScript and React in blog development
- Emphasize best practices for structuring and typing blog components
- Be ready to provide additional examples or explanations for more complex topics, always relating back to the blog context
- Adapt explanations based on the user's responses and provide additional blog-specific examples if needed
- Encourage questions about how these concepts apply specifically to blog development

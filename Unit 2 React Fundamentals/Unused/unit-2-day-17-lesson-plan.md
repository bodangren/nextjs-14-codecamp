# Unit 2, Day 17: Advanced State and Lifecycle in React Lesson Plan

## Course Structure Guidelines

This course is delivered by an AI Language Model (LLM) with the following structure:

1. Each day's session lasts approximately 3-4 hours.
2. The LLM breaks down topics into small, manageable chunks.
3. For each chunk:
   a. The LLM presents the information.
   b. Comprehension-check questions are asked to ensure understanding.
   c. The LLM corrects any misunderstandings.
   d. Where relevant, short code submissions are requested from the user.
   e. The LLM provides guidance to improve the user's code.
4. Once per topic, there's a more extensive coding/implementation challenge (about 30 minutes long).
5. The LLM evaluates the user's solution to this challenge.

## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this session, students should be able to:
1. Manage complex state with useReducer
2. Optimize performance using useMemo and useCallback
3. Create custom hooks for reusable stateful logic
4. Handle advanced side effects scenarios with useEffect

## Content Chunks

### Chunk 1: Complex State Management with useReducer (45 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Introduction to useReducer hook
- When to use useReducer over useState
- Reducer function and action structure
- Dispatch function and state updates

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. In what scenarios would you choose useReducer over useState?
2. How does the dispatch function work in useReducer?

#### Practical Task:
Ask the user to refactor the counter component from Day 16 to use useReducer, adding increment, decrement, and reset functionality.

### Chunk 2: Performance Optimization with useMemo and useCallback (45 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Purpose and usage of useMemo
- Purpose and usage of useCallback
- Memoization and its benefits
- When to use memoization hooks

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. What is the main difference between useMemo and useCallback?
2. In what situations would you consider using useMemo or useCallback?

#### Practical Task:
Guide the user through optimizing a component that performs expensive calculations by using useMemo, and create a memoized callback function using useCallback.

### Chunk 3: Creating Custom Hooks (60 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Concept and benefits of custom hooks
- Rules for creating custom hooks
- Composing hooks
- Sharing stateful logic between components

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. What are the naming conventions for custom hooks?
2. How do custom hooks promote code reuse in React applications?

#### Practical Task:
Ask the user to create a custom hook `useLocalStorage` that provides a way to persist state in localStorage, then use it in a component.

### Chunk 4: Advanced useEffect Scenarios (60 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Handling race conditions in data fetching
- Debouncing and throttling with useEffect
- Implementing infinite scrolling
- Managing subscriptions and event listeners

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. How can you handle race conditions when fetching data with useEffect?
2. What is the difference between debouncing and throttling, and when would you use each?

#### Practical Task:
Guide the user through implementing a search input with debounced API calls using useEffect and a custom hook.

## Extended Coding Challenge (30 minutes)

Create a "Task Management" application with the following requirements:

1. Use useReducer for managing tasks (add, toggle, delete)
2. Implement a custom hook useTaskPersistence for saving and loading tasks from localStorage
3. Use useMemo to memoize the count of completed and uncompleted tasks
4. Implement a debounced search functionality using useEffect and useCallback
5. Add the ability to fetch task suggestions from an API (use setTimeout to mock API calls)

Evaluation Criteria:
- Correct implementation of useReducer for task management
- Proper use of custom hooks for persistence and search functionality
- Effective use of useMemo and useCallback for optimization
- Correct handling of side effects with useEffect
- Clean and readable code structure
- User-friendly interface with all required functionalities

## Notes for LLM Instructor
- Build upon the concepts from Day 16, showing how these advanced hooks solve more complex state and lifecycle scenarios.
- Use diagrams or code visualizations to explain complex concepts like the reducer pattern.
- Provide real-world examples of when and why these advanced hooks are used in production applications.
- Be prepared to explain the performance implications of using hooks like useMemo and useCallback.
- Guide students through common pitfalls when implementing these hooks, especially with dependency arrays.
- Emphasize the importance of not overusing optimization hooks and when simple solutions are sufficient.
- Be ready to provide additional examples or explanations for more complex topics.
- Remember to adapt explanations based on the user's responses and provide additional examples if needed.
- Encourage questions and create a supportive learning environment.

# Unit 2, Day 15: Advanced Components and Props Lesson Plan

## Course Structure Guidelines

This course is delivered by an AI Language Model (LLM) with the following structure:

1. Each day's session lasts approximately 3-4 hours.
2. The LLM breaks down topics into small, manageable chunks.
3. For each chunk:
   a. The LLM presents the information.
   b. Comprehension-check questions are asked to ensure understanding.
   c. The LLM corrects any misunderstandings.
   d. Where relevant, short code submissions are requested from the user.
   e. The LLM provides guidance to improve the user's code.
4. Once per topic, there's a more extensive coding/implementation challenge (about 30 minutes long).
5. The LLM evaluates the user's solution to this challenge.

## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this session, students should be able to:
1. Implement component composition effectively
2. Use render props pattern for flexible component design
3. Understand and use higher-order components (HOCs)
4. Apply advanced TypeScript techniques with React components and props

## Content Chunks

### Chunk 1: Component Composition (45 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- The concept of composition in React
- Advantages of composition over inheritance
- Specialized components and container components
- Using the children prop for composition

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. How does composition differ from inheritance in React component design?
2. What is the purpose of the children prop in React?

#### Practical Task:
Ask the user to create a `Card` component that uses composition to wrap any content passed to it, including a title prop and children content.

### Chunk 2: Render Props Pattern (45 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- What are render props?
- Use cases for render props
- Implementing the render props pattern
- Advantages and potential drawbacks of render props

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. What problem does the render props pattern solve?
2. How does the render props pattern promote component reusability?

#### Practical Task:
Guide the user through creating a `ToggleComponent` that uses the render props pattern to control the visibility of its content.

### Chunk 3: Higher-Order Components (HOCs) (60 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Definition and purpose of HOCs
- Creating and using HOCs
- Common use cases for HOCs (e.g., loading data, authentication)
- Composing multiple HOCs

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. What is a higher-order component and how does it differ from a regular component?
2. What are some common scenarios where you might use an HOC?

#### Practical Task:
Ask the user to create a `withLoading` HOC that adds loading functionality to any component it wraps.

### Chunk 4: Advanced TypeScript with React Components (60 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Generic components in TypeScript
- Using TypeScript with HOCs
- Advanced prop types (union types, intersection types)
- Typing render props

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. How do you create a generic component in TypeScript?
2. What are the challenges of typing HOCs in TypeScript and how can you address them?

#### Practical Task:
Guide the user through refactoring the `ToggleComponent` to use TypeScript, including proper typing for its render prop.

## Extended Coding Challenge (30 minutes)

Create a reusable `DataFetcher` component that demonstrates advanced component patterns and TypeScript usage:

1. Implement the component using the render props pattern
2. The component should handle fetching data from an API endpoint (use a mock API or `setTimeout` to simulate API calls)
3. Use TypeScript generics to allow the component to work with different data types
4. Include loading and error states
5. Create an HOC version of this component named `withDataFetching`
6. Demonstrate the usage of both the render prop version and the HOC version with a simple `UserList` component

Evaluation Criteria:
- Correct implementation of render props pattern
- Proper use of TypeScript generics
- Effective error and loading state handling
- Correct implementation of the HOC pattern
- Clear demonstration of how to use both versions of the component

## Notes for LLM Instructor
- Build upon the concepts from Day 14, showing how these advanced patterns solve real-world problems.
- Use diagrams or code visualizations to explain complex concepts like HOCs and render props.
- Provide real-world examples of when and why these patterns are used in production applications.
- Be prepared to explain the trade-offs between different component patterns.
- Guide students through common pitfalls when implementing these patterns, especially with TypeScript.
- Emphasize the importance of readability and maintainability when using advanced patterns.
- Be ready to provide additional examples or explanations for more complex topics.
- Remember to adapt explanations based on the user's responses and provide additional examples if needed.
- Encourage questions and create a supportive learning environment.

Ask the student to set up a basic GitHub Actions workflow for their Next.js project:
1. Create a `.github/workflows` directory in their repository
2. Create a simple workflow file that runs on push to the main branch
3. Implement a basic job that checks out the code and lists the directory contents

### Chunk 2: Implementing Automated Testing with GitHub Actions (60 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Setting up a testing environment in GitHub Actions
- Configuring Node.js and dependency installation
- Running different types of tests (unit, integration, e2e)
- Handling test artifacts and reports

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. How can we ensure our tests run in an environment similar to our development setup?
2. What strategies can we use to optimize the speed of our test runs?
3. How can we effectively handle and display test results in GitHub Actions?

#### Practical Task:
Guide the student in setting up automated testing for their Next.js application:
1. Modify the GitHub Actions workflow to set up Node.js and install dependencies
2. Implement jobs for running unit and integration tests
3. Add a job for running end-to-end tests (if applicable)
4. Configure the workflow to upload test reports as artifacts

### Chunk 3: Implementing Deployment Pipeline to GCP (75 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Authenticating GitHub Actions with GCP
- Setting up secrets for secure credential management
- Creating a deployment job in the workflow
- Implementing different deployment strategies (e.g., rolling update, blue-green)

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. How can we securely authenticate GitHub Actions with GCP?
2. What are the key steps in a deployment job for a Next.js application?
3. What are the advantages and disadvantages of different deployment strategies?

#### Practical Task:
Ask the student to implement a deployment pipeline for their Next.js application:
1. Set up GCP authentication in GitHub Actions using a service account
2. Create secrets in the GitHub repository for GCP credentials
3. Implement a deployment job that builds and deploys the application to Cloud Run
4. Configure the deployment to only run on successful completion of the testing jobs

### Chunk 4: Managing Staging and Production Environments (60 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Concepts of staging and production environments
- Implementing environment-specific configurations
- Creating separate workflows for staging and production deployments
- Implementing manual approvals for production deployments

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. Why is it important to have separate staging and production environments?
2. How can we manage environment-specific configurations in our Next.js application?
3. What are the benefits of implementing manual approvals for production deployments?

#### Practical Task:
Guide the student in setting up staging and production environments:
1. Create separate Cloud Run services for staging and production
2. Implement environment-specific configurations in the Next.js application
3. Modify the GitHub Actions workflow to deploy to staging on every push to the main branch
4. Create a separate workflow for production deployment with a manual approval step

### Chunk 5: CI/CD Best Practices and Optimization (30 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Strategies for optimizing CI/CD pipeline performance
- Implementing caching in GitHub Actions
- Security best practices for CI/CD pipelines
- Monitoring and maintaining CI/CD pipelines

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. What strategies can we use to optimize the speed of our CI/CD pipeline?
2. How can we ensure the security of our CI/CD pipeline?
3. What metrics should we monitor to maintain a healthy CI/CD pipeline?

#### Practical Task:
Ask the student to optimize their CI/CD pipeline:
1. Implement caching for Node.js dependencies in the GitHub Actions workflow
2. Set up branch protection rules to enforce CI checks before merging
3. Implement a job to scan for security vulnerabilities in dependencies

## Extended Coding Challenge (90 minutes)

Enhance the Next.js application's CI/CD pipeline with the following advanced features:

1. Implement a multi-stage deployment pipeline (dev, staging, production)
2. Set up automatic rollback in case of deployment failures
3. Implement feature flag management integrated with the CI/CD pipeline
4. Create a notification system for successful/failed deployments (e.g., Slack integration)
5. Implement performance testing as part of the CI/CD pipeline
6. Set up automatic generation and deployment of application documentation

The project should demonstrate:
- A comprehensive, production-ready CI/CD pipeline
- Implementation of advanced deployment strategies
- Integration of various GCP services in the CI/CD process
- Adherence to DevOps best practices

Evaluation Criteria:
- Correct implementation of multi-stage deployment pipeline
- Effectiveness of the automatic rollback mechanism
- Proper integration of feature flag management
- Functionality of the notification system
- Quality and relevance of performance tests in the pipeline
- Usefulness of the automatically generated documentation
- Overall robustness and efficiency of the CI/CD pipeline
- Clear documentation of the CI/CD process and its components

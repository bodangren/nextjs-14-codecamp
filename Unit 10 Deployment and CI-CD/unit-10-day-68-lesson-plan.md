## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this session, students should be able to:
1. Understand the key considerations for deploying Next.js applications
2. Set up a Google Cloud Platform account and project
3. Prepare a Next.js application for production deployment
4. Deploy a Next.js application to GCP App Engine
5. Configure a custom domain and SSL certificate for the deployed application

## Content Chunks

### Chunk 1: Introduction to Deployment Considerations for Next.js (30 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Overview of deployment processes for web applications
- Specific considerations for Next.js applications (server-side rendering, API routes, static optimization)
- Introduction to cloud platforms and their benefits
- Overview of Google Cloud Platform and its services relevant to Next.js deployment

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. What are some key differences between deploying a static website and a Next.js application?
2. Why might we choose a cloud platform like GCP for deploying our Next.js application?
3. What GCP services are particularly relevant for Next.js deployments?

#### Practical Task:
Ask the student to research and list three potential challenges they might face when deploying a Next.js application, and how these challenges might be addressed.

### Chunk 2: Setting Up Google Cloud Platform (45 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Creating a GCP account
- Setting up a new GCP project
- Enabling necessary APIs (App Engine, Cloud Build)
- Installing and configuring the Google Cloud SDK

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. What is the purpose of creating a separate GCP project for our Next.js application?
2. Why do we need to enable specific APIs in our GCP project?
3. How does the Google Cloud SDK help in the deployment process?

#### Practical Task:
Guide the student through the process of setting up their GCP account and creating a new project for their Next.js application. This includes:
1. Creating a GCP account (if they don't already have one)
2. Setting up a new GCP project
3. Enabling the App Engine and Cloud Build APIs
4. Installing the Google Cloud SDK on their local machine

### Chunk 3: Preparing a Next.js Application for Production Deployment (60 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Optimizing Next.js builds for production
- Configuring environment variables for different environments
- Implementing proper error handling and logging
- Setting up a custom server (if necessary)

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. What command do we use to create a production build of a Next.js application?
2. How can we manage environment variables for different deployment environments in Next.js?
3. Why might we need to set up a custom server for our Next.js application?

#### Practical Task:
Ask the student to prepare their existing Next.js application (from previous units) for production deployment. They should:
1. Create a production build of their application
2. Set up environment variables for production
3. Implement basic error handling and logging
4. Test the production build locally

### Chunk 4: Deploying to GCP App Engine (45 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Introduction to GCP App Engine
- Creating an `app.yaml` configuration file
- Using the `gcloud` command to deploy the application
- Viewing and managing the deployed application in the GCP Console

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. What is GCP App Engine and why is it suitable for Next.js applications?
2. What is the purpose of the `app.yaml` file?
3. How can we monitor our deployed application using the GCP Console?

#### Practical Task:
Guide the student in deploying their prepared Next.js application to GCP App Engine. They should:
1. Create an `app.yaml` file with appropriate configurations
2. Use the `gcloud` command to deploy their application
3. Verify the deployment in the GCP Console
4. Access their deployed application via the provided URL

### Chunk 5: Configuring Custom Domain and SSL (60 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Mapping a custom domain to the App Engine application
- Setting up DNS records
- Configuring SSL certificates using GCP's managed SSL certificates

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. Why might we want to use a custom domain for our deployed application?
2. What DNS records are typically needed when mapping a custom domain to App Engine?
3. What are the benefits of using GCP's managed SSL certificates?

#### Practical Task:
Ask the student to configure a custom domain and SSL certificate for their deployed application. They should:
1. Add a custom domain to their App Engine application in the GCP Console
2. Set up the necessary DNS records (if they own a domain)
3. Enable and configure a managed SSL certificate for their custom domain

## Extended Coding Challenge (90 minutes)

Enhance the deployed Next.js application with the following features:

1. Implement a staging environment alongside the production environment
2. Set up environment-specific configuration for the staging and production environments
3. Create a script to automate the deployment process to both environments
4. Implement basic performance monitoring using GCP's Cloud Monitoring
5. Set up Cloud Logging to aggregate logs from the application
6. Create a simple dashboard in the GCP Console to monitor application health and performance

The project should demonstrate:
- Proper configuration of staging and production environments
- Efficient use of GCP services for deployment and monitoring
- Automated deployment process
- Basic application monitoring and logging

Evaluation Criteria:
- Correct implementation of staging and production environments
- Proper use of environment-specific configurations
- Functionality of the automated deployment script
- Effective use of Cloud Monitoring and Cloud Logging
- Clarity and usefulness of the monitoring dashboard
- Consideration of security best practices in the deployment process
- Clear documentation of the deployment and monitoring setup

- Deploying a container to Cloud Run
- Configuring Cloud Run service settings

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. What modifications, if any, are needed to prepare a Next.js app for Cloud Run?
2. How do we push our Docker image to Container Registry?
3. What are some important settings to consider when configuring a Cloud Run service?

#### Practical Task:
Guide the student through the process of deploying their Next.js application to Cloud Run:
1. Build a Docker image of their Next.js app
2. Push the image to Container Registry
3. Deploy the image to Cloud Run
4. Configure the Cloud Run service settings

### Chunk 3: Implementing Cloud Storage for Static Assets (45 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Introduction to Cloud Storage and its use cases
- Configuring Next.js to use Cloud Storage for static assets
- Uploading and managing assets in Cloud Storage
- Implementing proper access controls for Cloud Storage buckets

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. Why might we want to use Cloud Storage for static assets in a Next.js application?
2. How can we configure Next.js to use Cloud Storage for asset serving?
3. What security considerations should we keep in mind when using Cloud Storage?

#### Practical Task:
Ask the student to set up Cloud Storage for their Next.js application's static assets:
1. Create a Cloud Storage bucket
2. Configure their Next.js app to use the bucket for static asset storage
3. Upload some sample static assets
4. Implement proper access controls for the bucket

### Chunk 4: Setting up Cloud CDN for Improved Performance (45 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Introduction to Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)
- Overview of Google Cloud CDN
- Configuring Cloud CDN with Cloud Storage and Cloud Run
- Measuring performance improvements with Cloud CDN

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. What is a CDN and how does it improve application performance?
2. How does Google Cloud CDN integrate with Cloud Storage and Cloud Run?
3. What types of content are best suited for CDN caching?

#### Practical Task:
Guide the student in setting up Cloud CDN for their deployed application:
1. Enable Cloud CDN for their Cloud Storage bucket
2. Configure caching behavior for different types of assets
3. Test and measure the performance improvements

### Chunk 5: Managing Environment Variables and Security in GCP (45 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Strategies for managing environment variables in GCP
- Using Secret Manager for sensitive information
- Implementing IAM roles and permissions
- Best practices for securing deployed applications

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. How can we manage environment variables for different deployment environments in GCP?
2. What is Secret Manager and when should we use it?
3. What are some best practices for securing a deployed Next.js application on GCP?

#### Practical Task:
Ask the student to implement proper environment variable management and security measures:
1. Set up environment variables for their Cloud Run service
2. Store a sensitive value (e.g., API key) in Secret Manager
3. Configure appropriate IAM roles for their project
4. Implement at least two security best practices for their deployed application

## Extended Coding Challenge (90 minutes)

Enhance the Next.js application deployed on GCP with the following features:

1. Implement a multi-region deployment setup using Cloud Run
2. Set up Cloud Storage replication for static assets across regions
3. Configure Cloud CDN with custom caching rules for different types of content
4. Implement a basic CI/CD pipeline using Cloud Build
5. Set up Cloud Armor for Web Application Firewall (WAF) protection
6. Implement detailed request logging and monitoring using Cloud Logging and Cloud Monitoring

The project should demonstrate:
- Effective use of GCP services for a globally distributed application
- Proper implementation of performance optimization techniques
- Basic CI/CD automation
- Implementation of security best practices

Evaluation Criteria:
- Correct implementation of multi-region deployment
- Effective use of Cloud Storage and Cloud CDN for static asset delivery
- Functionality and efficiency of the CI/CD pipeline
- Proper configuration of Cloud Armor for security
- Effectiveness of logging and monitoring setup
- Consideration of cost optimization in the overall architecture
- Clear documentation of the deployment architecture and security measures

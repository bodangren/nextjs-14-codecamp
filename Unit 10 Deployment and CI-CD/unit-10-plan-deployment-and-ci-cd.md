# Unit 10: Deployment and CI/CD

## Overview
This unit covers the deployment of Next.js 14 applications to the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and setting up continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. Students will learn how to configure GCP for hosting Next.js applications and automate the deployment process using GitHub Actions and other CI/CD tools.

## Learning Objectives
- Deploy Next.js 14 applications to Google Cloud Platform
- Configure GCP services for Next.js applications
- Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment
- Utilize advanced GCP services to enhance Next.js applications

## Key Topics
- Deploying Next.js 14 to Google Cloud Platform
- Advanced GCP services for Next.js applications
- Setting up CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions
- Automating deployment and testing processes

- Set up and configure Google Cloud Platform for hosting Next.js apps
- Implement advanced GCP services to enhance application performance and scalability
- Create and manage CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions
- Apply best practices for secure and efficient deployment
- Implement monitoring and logging for deployed applications

## Key Topics
- Next.js production builds and optimization
- Google Cloud Platform setup and configuration
- Deploying Next.js applications to GCP App Engine and Cloud Run
- Implementing Cloud Storage for static assets
- Setting up Cloud CDN for improved performance
- Configuring custom domains and SSL certificates
- Introduction to GitHub Actions
- Creating CI/CD workflows for automated testing and deployment
- Implementing staging and production environments
- Monitoring and logging with GCP tools

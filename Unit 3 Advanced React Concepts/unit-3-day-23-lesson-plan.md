# Unit 3, Day 23: Advanced Custom Hooks for Blog Features Lesson Plan

## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this session, students should be able to:
1. Enhance existing custom hooks with advanced functionality for blog features
2. Create new custom hooks for additional blog functionality
3. Implement performance optimizations in custom hooks using useCallback and useMemo
4. Apply TypeScript for robust type checking in complex custom hooks

## Content Chunks

### Chunk 1: Enhancing useComments Hook (60 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Adding advanced features to the useComments hook (e.g., comment sorting, filtering)
- Implementing real-time updates for comments using WebSockets (simulated)
- Optimizing performance with useCallback and useMemo
- Advanced TypeScript typing for complex comment structures

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. How does useCallback improve the performance of our useComments hook?
2. What are the benefits of implementing real-time updates for blog comments?

#### Practical Task:
Guide the user through enhancing the useComments hook with sorting functionality and simulated real-time updates.

### Chunk 2: Expanding usePostViews Hook (45 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Implementing analytics tracking within the usePostViews hook
- Adding time-based view count aggregation (e.g., daily, weekly views)
- Using localStorage for persistent view counts across sessions
- Handling race conditions in view count updates

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. Why is it important to handle race conditions when updating view counts?
2. How can we use localStorage to improve the user experience with view counts?

#### Practical Task:
Ask the user to extend the usePostViews hook to include time-based view count aggregation and localStorage persistence.

### Chunk 3: Creating a useTagManagement Hook (60 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Designing a custom hook for managing blog post tags
- Implementing tag suggestion functionality
- Creating a tag search and filter system
- Using TypeScript for type-safe tag management

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. How does a dedicated useTagManagement hook improve our blog's architecture?
2. What are some challenges in implementing an efficient tag suggestion system?

#### Practical Task:
Guide the user through creating a new useTagManagement hook that handles tag creation, suggestion, and searching.

### Chunk 4: Implementing a useBookmark Hook (45 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Designing a custom hook for user bookmarks in the blog
- Managing bookmark state across multiple components
- Implementing bookmark synchronization with a backend (simulated)
- Using TypeScript for type checking in bookmark operations

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. How can we ensure bookmark state remains consistent across different parts of our blog?
2. What are the advantages of using a custom hook for bookmark management?

#### Practical Task:
Ask the user to create a useBookmark hook that allows users to bookmark blog posts and manage their bookmarks.

## Extended Coding Challenge (30 minutes)

Enhance the "BlogPost" component from Day 22 by incorporating the new and improved custom hooks. Create a "BlogPostManager" component that uses these hooks to provide a comprehensive blog post management interface. The component should:

1. Use the enhanced useComments hook for advanced comment functionality
2. Implement the expanded usePostViews hook for detailed view analytics
3. Utilize the new useTagManagement hook for tag handling
4. Incorporate the useBookmark hook for bookmark functionality

The BlogPostManager component should include:
- Post content display with view count and analytics
- Advanced comment section with sorting and real-time updates
- Tag management interface with suggestions and search
- Bookmark toggle and management

Evaluation Criteria:
- Correct implementation and integration of all custom hooks
- Effective use of useCallback and useMemo for performance optimization
- Proper management of complex state across multiple features
- Correct TypeScript typing throughout the component
- Clean, organized, and reusable code structure
- Simulated real-time updates and backend synchronization

## Notes for LLM Instructor
- Emphasize how these advanced custom hooks contribute to a more robust and feature-rich blog application
- Encourage students to think about real-world blog platforms and how these hooks mirror professional-grade features
- Provide guidance on structuring complex custom hooks for maintainability
- Be prepared to explain performance optimization techniques in the context of hook composition
- Offer insights into handling real-time updates and backend synchronization in custom hooks
- Adapt explanations based on the user's responses and provide additional blog-specific examples if needed
- Encourage questions and foster a collaborative learning environment
- Remind students how these advanced hooks fit into the larger architecture of the Personal Blog Application project

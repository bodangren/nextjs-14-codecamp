# Unit 3: Advanced React Concepts for Personal Blog Application

## Overview
This unit builds upon the foundation laid in previous units, focusing on advanced React concepts to enhance the Personal Blog Application. Students will learn to implement custom hooks, leverage React 18 features, and optimize performance, all within the context of improving their blog project.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this unit, students should be able to:
- Create and implement custom hooks to enhance blog functionality
- Utilize advanced state management techniques for complex blog features
- Implement error boundaries and Suspense for improved user experience
- Optimize the blog application's performance using React 18 features

## Project Context
Students will continue developing the Personal Blog Application, focusing on implementing advanced React concepts to add sophisticated features and improve overall performance.

## Daily Breakdown

### Day 22-23: Custom Hooks for Blog Features
- Main concepts to cover:
  - Creating custom hooks for reusable blog logic
  - Implementing a useComments hook for managing blog post comments
  - Developing a usePostViews hook to track and display post view counts
- Practical tasks:
  - Create a useComments hook that manages comment state and submission
  - Implement a usePostViews hook that tracks and updates view counts for blog posts
  - Refactor existing components to use these custom hooks
- Comprehension check questions:
  - How do custom hooks improve code reusability in our blog application?
  - What are the benefits of using a custom hook for comment management?

### Day 24-25: Advanced State Management for Blog Features
- Main concepts to cover:
  - Using Context API for global blog state (e.g., user authentication, theme)
  - Implementing useReducer for complex state logic in blog features
  - Combining Context and useReducer for efficient state management
- Practical tasks:
  - Create a global authentication context for the blog
  - Implement a theme switcher using Context API
  - Use useReducer to manage complex comment thread state
- Comprehension check questions:
  - How does the Context API simplify state management across our blog components?
  - In what scenarios is useReducer preferable to useState in our blog application?

### Day 26-27: Error Handling and Data Fetching with Suspense
- Main concepts to cover:
  - Implementing error boundaries for graceful error handling in blog components
  - Using Suspense for improved loading states when fetching blog data
  - Lazy loading blog components for performance optimization
- Practical tasks:
  - Create an error boundary component for the blog post display
  - Implement Suspense when fetching blog posts and comments
  - Use lazy loading for the comment section of blog posts
- Comprehension check questions:
  - How do error boundaries improve user experience in our blog?
  - What are the benefits of using Suspense for data fetching in our blog application?

### Day 28: Performance Optimization for the Blog
- Main concepts to cover:
  - Using React.memo to optimize blog list rendering
  - Implementing useMemo and useCallback for expensive computations in blog features
  - Profiling and identifying performance bottlenecks in the blog application
- Practical tasks:
  - Optimize the BlogList component using React.memo
  - Use useMemo to memoize expensive comment sorting functions
  - Implement useCallback for event handlers in blog interaction components
- Comprehension check questions:
  - How does React.memo improve the performance of our blog list?
  - In what scenarios should we use useMemo and useCallback in our blog application?

## Unit Challenge: Enhanced Blog Feature Implementation
Implement an advanced feature for the Personal Blog Application that demonstrates mastery of the concepts covered in this unit. The feature should include:

1. A custom hook for managing a new blog functionality (e.g., bookmarking posts)
2. Advanced state management using Context API and useReducer
3. Error boundary implementation for graceful error handling
4. Performance optimization using React.memo, useMemo, or useCallback
5. Integration of Suspense for improved loading states

Evaluation Criteria:
- Effective use of custom hooks to encapsulate and reuse logic
- Proper implementation of Context API and useReducer for state management
- Appropriate use of error boundaries and Suspense
- Measurable performance improvements through optimization techniques
- Clean, well-organized code with proper TypeScript typing

## Notes for LLM Instructor
- Continuously relate advanced React concepts back to practical improvements in the Personal Blog Application
- Encourage students to think about how each new concept can enhance user experience or developer productivity in the context of the blog
- Provide concrete examples of how these advanced concepts solve real problems in blog development
- Guide students in refactoring existing blog components to incorporate new concepts
- Be prepared to explain the trade-offs of different approaches in the context of blog development
- Adapt explanations based on students' understanding, providing additional blog-centric examples as needed

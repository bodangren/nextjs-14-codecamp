# Unit 3: Advanced React 18 Concepts

## Overview
This unit delves into advanced React 18 concepts, focusing on the latest features, optimizing performance, managing complex state, and creating reusable patterns. Students will learn to build sophisticated React 18 applications using TypeScript, emphasizing best practices and design patterns compatible with Next.js 14.

## Learning Objectives
- Implement and utilize custom hooks for code reusability in React 18
- Understand and apply React 18's new features and APIs
- Master the use of Context API and new state management techniques in React 18
- Implement error boundaries and Suspense for improved error handling and loading states
- Optimize React 18 applications for better performance using the latest techniques

## Key Topics
- Custom hooks in React 18
- React 18 new features (automatic batching, transitions, Suspense)
- Context API and advanced state management in React 18
- Error boundaries, Suspense, and performance optimization

## Unit Challenge
Build a "Real-time Dashboard" application using React 18 and TypeScript, compatible with Next.js 14. The application should include:
- Custom hooks for data fetching using Suspense
- Context API with useReducer for global state management
- Use of transitions for improved user experience during updates
- Error boundaries and Suspense for graceful error handling and loading states
- Optimized rendering for real-time data updates

Evaluation criteria:
- Effective use of React 18 features (Suspense, transitions, automatic batching)
- Proper implementation of error boundaries and Suspense
- Appropriate use of performance optimization techniques
- Clean and organized code structure with proper TypeScript typing
- User-friendly interface with smooth interactions, leveraging React 18's concurrent features

# Unit 3, Day 22: Custom Hooks for Blog Features Lesson Plan

## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this session, students should be able to:
1. Understand the purpose and benefits of custom hooks in the context of a blog application
2. Create and use custom hooks effectively for blog-specific features
3. Implement a useComments hook for managing blog post comments
4. Develop a usePostViews hook for tracking and displaying post view counts

## Content Chunks

### Chunk 1: Introduction to Custom Hooks in Blog Development (45 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- What are custom hooks and why are they useful in blog applications?
- Rules of hooks in React 18
- How custom hooks improve code reusability and organization in blog components
- Examples of blog-specific custom hooks

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. What are the main benefits of using custom hooks in our Personal Blog Application?
2. How can custom hooks improve the organization of our blog's codebase?

#### Practical Task:
Ask the user to create a simple custom hook called `useFormInput` that manages the state of a form input field, including value and validation.

### Chunk 2: Implementing useComments Hook (60 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Designing a custom hook for managing blog post comments
- Using multiple React hooks within a custom hook
- State management for comments (adding, editing, deleting)
- TypeScript typing for the useComments hook

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. How does the useComments hook simplify comment management in our blog posts?
2. What are the key state elements we need to manage in the useComments hook?

#### Practical Task:
Guide the user through creating the `useComments` hook that manages comment state, including functions for adding, editing, and deleting comments.

### Chunk 3: Advanced Features of useComments Hook (60 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Implementing comment threading functionality
- Adding pagination or infinite scrolling for comments
- Optimistic updates for better user experience
- Error handling in the useComments hook

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. How can we implement comment threading using our useComments hook?
2. What are the benefits of optimistic updates in the context of blog comments?

#### Practical Task:
Ask the user to extend the `useComments` hook to include comment threading and optimistic updates for comment actions.

### Chunk 4: Developing usePostViews Hook (45 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Designing a custom hook for tracking post views
- Implementing view count updates
- Storing and retrieving view counts (local storage or mock API)
- Using TypeScript for type safety in the usePostViews hook

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. Why is it beneficial to create a separate hook for tracking post views?
2. How can we ensure our usePostViews hook is reusable across different components?

#### Practical Task:
Guide the user through creating the `usePostViews` hook that tracks and updates view counts for blog posts.

## Extended Coding Challenge (30 minutes)

Create a "BlogPost" component for the Personal Blog Application using React 18 and TypeScript that incorporates the custom hooks developed today. The component should:

1. Use the `useComments` hook to display and manage comments
2. Implement the `usePostViews` hook to show and update the post's view count
3. Use the `useFormInput` hook for a comment submission form

The BlogPost component should include:
- Post title and content (can be hardcoded for this challenge)
- View count display
- Comment section with threading
- Comment submission form

Evaluation Criteria:
- Correct implementation of custom hooks (useComments, usePostViews, useFormInput)
- Proper management of comment state, including threading
- Effective tracking and display of post view count
- Correct TypeScript typing throughout the component
- Clean and organized code structure
- Reusability of the custom hooks

## Notes for LLM Instructor
- Emphasize how custom hooks can simplify complex logic in blog components
- Use real-world examples from popular blog platforms to illustrate the importance of features like comment management and view tracking
- Encourage students to think about other potential custom hooks that could benefit the Personal Blog Application
- Provide guidance on best practices for naming and structuring custom hooks in the context of a blog application
- Be ready to troubleshoot common issues with TypeScript and React hook integration
- Adapt explanations based on the user's responses and provide additional blog-specific examples if needed
- Encourage questions and create a supportive learning environment
- Remind students how these custom hooks fit into the larger structure of the Personal Blog Application project

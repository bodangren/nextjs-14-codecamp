# Unit 3, Day 24: Advanced State Management in React 18 Lesson Plan

## Course Structure Guidelines

[The course structure guidelines remain the same as in the previous lesson plans]

## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this session, students should be able to:
1. Understand the Context API and its role in state management
2. Implement and use Context effectively in React 18
3. Combine useReducer with Context for complex state management
4. Optimize Context performance in React 18

## Content Chunks

### Chunk 1: Deep Dive into Context API (45 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Review of the Context API and its purpose
- Creating and providing context
- Consuming context with useContext hook
- Best practices for structuring context in React 18 applications

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. What are the main use cases for the Context API in React 18?
2. How does the useContext hook differ from the Consumer component approach?

#### Practical Task:
Ask the user to create a theme context that provides light and dark themes to components, including a toggle function to switch between themes.

### Chunk 2: Advanced Context Patterns (45 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Using multiple contexts in a single application
- Context composition patterns
- Creating a custom provider component
- Typescript with Context for improved type safety

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. What are the benefits of using multiple contexts instead of a single large context?
2. How can TypeScript improve the usage of Context in React applications?

#### Practical Task:
Guide the user through creating a custom authentication context with TypeScript, including a custom provider that manages login and logout functionality.

### Chunk 3: Combining useReducer with Context (60 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Understanding useReducer and its benefits
- Implementing complex state logic with useReducer
- Combining useReducer with Context for global state management
- Comparing this approach with other state management solutions (e.g., Redux)

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. How does combining useReducer with Context compare to using useState with Context?
2. What types of applications benefit most from the useReducer + Context approach?

#### Practical Task:
Ask the user to refactor the authentication context from Chunk 2 to use useReducer for managing login state, token storage, and user information.

### Chunk 4: Optimizing Context Performance in React 18 (60 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Understanding React 18's improvements to Context performance
- Techniques for minimizing unnecessary re-renders with Context
- Using useMemo and useCallback with Context providers
- Implementing context splitting for performance optimization

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. How does React 18 improve Context performance compared to previous versions?
2. What are some common pitfalls that can lead to performance issues when using Context?

#### Practical Task:
Guide the user through optimizing a complex Context provider that manages multiple slices of state, using techniques like context splitting and memoization.

## Extended Coding Challenge (30 minutes)

Create a "Task Management Application" using React 18, TypeScript, and advanced state management techniques. The application should:

1. Use Context API for global state management
2. Implement useReducer for complex state logic
3. Optimize performance using React 18 features
4. Handle authentication state and task state separately

The application should include:
- A login/logout system using an authentication context
- A task list with the ability to add, complete, and delete tasks
- Filtering options for tasks (all, active, completed)
- A performance-optimized task input component

Evaluation Criteria:
- Correct implementation of Context API for global state
- Proper use of useReducer for managing complex state
- Effective performance optimization techniques
- Correct separation of concerns between authentication and task management
- Proper TypeScript typing throughout the application
- Clean and organized code structure

## Notes for LLM Instructor
- Emphasize the importance of choosing the right state management solution for the application's needs.
- Use real-world examples to illustrate the benefits and trade-offs of different state management approaches.
- Be prepared to explain the performance implications of Context usage in depth.
- Encourage students to think about the structure of their global state and how to organize it effectively.
- Provide guidance on best practices for combining useReducer with Context.
- Be ready to troubleshoot common issues with TypeScript and Context integration.
- Adapt explanations based on the user's responses and provide additional examples if needed.
- Encourage questions and create a supportive learning environment.

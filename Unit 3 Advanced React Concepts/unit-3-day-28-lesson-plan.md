# Unit 3, Day 28: Performance Optimization in React 18 Lesson Plan

## Course Structure Guidelines

[The course structure guidelines remain the same as in the previous lesson plans]

## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this session, students should be able to:
1. Understand and implement React.memo for component memoization
2. Effectively use useMemo and useCallback hooks for optimization
3. Profile and identify performance bottlenecks in React 18 applications
4. Implement advanced performance optimization techniques specific to React 18

## Content Chunks

### Chunk 1: Deep Dive into React.memo (45 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Understanding component re-renders and their impact on performance
- How React.memo works and when to use it
- Customizing React.memo with comparison functions
- Common pitfalls and best practices when using React.memo

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. In what scenarios is React.memo most beneficial?
2. How does React.memo differ from PureComponent in class components?

#### Practical Task:
Ask the user to identify and optimize a component that's re-rendering unnecessarily using React.memo, and implement a custom comparison function for a complex prop structure.

### Chunk 2: Optimizing with useMemo and useCallback (45 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Understanding memoization in the context of React hooks
- Use cases and implementation of useMemo
- Optimizing callback functions with useCallback
- Performance implications of excessive memoization

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. What are the key differences between useMemo and useCallback?
2. In what situations might memoization with these hooks negatively impact performance?

#### Practical Task:
Guide the user through refactoring a component with expensive computations, using useMemo to optimize the calculations and useCallback to memoize event handlers passed to child components.

### Chunk 3: Profiling and Identifying Performance Bottlenecks (60 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Introduction to React DevTools Profiler
- Identifying unnecessary re-renders and expensive operations
- Using the Profiler API programmatically
- Interpreting profiling results and making optimization decisions

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. What key metrics should you look for when profiling a React application?
2. How can the Profiler API be used to gather performance data in production?

#### Practical Task:
Ask the user to profile a given React application, identify performance bottlenecks, and propose optimization strategies based on the profiling results.

### Chunk 4: Advanced Performance Optimization Techniques in React 18 (60 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Leveraging automatic batching in React 18
- Using startTransition for expensive state updates
- Implementing windowing or virtualization for long lists
- Code splitting and lazy loading strategies in React 18

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. How does automatic batching in React 18 improve performance compared to previous versions?
2. What are the benefits of using windowing techniques for rendering large lists?

#### Practical Task:
Guide the user through implementing a virtualized list component using a library like react-window, and optimize its performance using React 18 features like automatic batching and transitions.

## Extended Coding Challenge (30 minutes)

Create a "High-Performance Dashboard" using React 18, TypeScript, and the optimization techniques learned throughout the unit. The dashboard should:

1. Display multiple widgets with different data visualizations
2. Implement efficient rendering of large datasets using virtualization
3. Optimize expensive computations with useMemo and useCallback
4. Use React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders
5. Implement code splitting and lazy loading for different dashboard sections
6. Utilize React 18's concurrent features for improved responsiveness

The dashboard should include:
- A header with user info and global controls (memoized)
- A sidebar with navigation menu (optimized with React.memo)
- Multiple data visualization widgets (charts, tables with virtualization)
- A search feature with autocomplete (optimized with useCallback and useMemo)
- Lazy-loaded settings and help sections

Evaluation Criteria:
- Effective use of React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback
- Proper implementation of virtualization for large datasets
- Correct usage of code splitting and lazy loading
- Appropriate use of React 18's concurrent features
- Measurable performance improvements (verified with Profiler)
- Correct TypeScript typing throughout the application
- Clean, organized, and performant code structure

## Notes for LLM Instructor
- Emphasize the importance of measuring performance before and after optimizations.
- Use real-world examples to illustrate when certain optimization techniques are most beneficial.
- Be prepared to explain the potential downsides of premature or unnecessary optimization.
- Encourage students to think about the balance between code readability and performance.
- Provide guidance on creating a culture of performance in React development.
- Be ready to discuss how React 18's improvements impact existing optimization techniques.
- Adapt explanations based on the user's responses and provide additional examples if needed.
- Encourage questions and create a supportive learning environment.

# Unit 1, Day 10: Asynchronous Programming in TypeScript (Part 1) Lesson Plan

## Course Structure Guidelines

This course is delivered by an AI Language Model (LLM) with the following structure:

1. Each day's session lasts approximately 3-4 hours.
2. The LLM breaks down topics into small, manageable chunks.
3. For each chunk:
   a. The LLM presents the information.
   b. Comprehension-check questions are asked to ensure understanding.
   c. The LLM corrects any misunderstandings.
   d. Where relevant, short code submissions are requested from the user.
   e. The LLM provides guidance to improve the user's code.
4. Once per topic, there's a more extensive coding/implementation challenge (about 30 minutes long).
5. The LLM evaluates the user's solution to this challenge.

## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this session, students should be able to:
1. Understand the concepts of synchronous vs asynchronous programming
2. Work with Promises in TypeScript
3. Use async/await syntax effectively
4. Handle errors in asynchronous code
5. Apply TypeScript types to asynchronous operations

## Content Chunks

### Chunk 1: Introduction to Asynchronous Programming (45 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Synchronous vs asynchronous programming
- The event loop and non-blocking I/O
- Callbacks and their limitations
- Introduction to Promises

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. What's the difference between synchronous and asynchronous code execution?
2. Why is asynchronous programming important in JavaScript/TypeScript?

#### Practical Task:
Guide the user through converting a synchronous operation to an asynchronous one using setTimeout and callbacks.

### Chunk 2: Promises in TypeScript (45 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Creating and consuming Promises
- Promise states (pending, fulfilled, rejected)
- Chaining Promises
- TypeScript types for Promises

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. How does TypeScript enhance type safety when working with Promises?
2. What's the difference between `Promise<T>` and `Promise<void>`?

#### Practical Task:
Ask the user to implement a series of chained operations using Promises, such as a multi-step data processing pipeline.

### Chunk 3: Async/Await Syntax (45 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Introduction to async/await
- Converting Promise chains to async/await
- Error handling with try/catch
- Async functions and their return types

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. How does async/await simplify asynchronous code compared to raw Promises?
2. What type does an async function always return?

#### Practical Task:
Guide the user through refactoring a Promise-based function to use async/await syntax.

### Chunk 4: Error Handling in Asynchronous Code (45 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Handling errors in Promise chains
- Try/catch blocks with async/await
- Creating and throwing custom errors
- The `finally` clause

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. How does error handling differ between Promise chains and async/await?
2. When would you use a `finally` block in asynchronous code?

#### Practical Task:
Ask the user to implement robust error handling for an asynchronous operation, including custom error types.

### Chunk 5: TypeScript and Asynchronous Operations (30 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Type annotations for async functions
- Using generics with Promises
- The `Awaited<T>` utility type
- Best practices for typing asynchronous code

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. How can you use TypeScript to improve the type safety of asynchronous code?
2. What does the `Awaited<T>` utility type do?

#### Practical Task:
Guide the user through adding comprehensive type annotations to a series of asynchronous functions.

## Extended Coding Challenge (30 minutes)

Create a simple asynchronous task runner in TypeScript. The system should:

1. Define a `Task` type that represents an asynchronous operation
2. Implement a `TaskQueue` class that can add and execute tasks sequentially
3. Use Promises and async/await for task execution
4. Implement proper error handling and task cancellation
5. Use TypeScript features to ensure type safety throughout the system

Evaluation Criteria:
- Correct use of Promises and async/await
- Proper implementation of error handling
- Effective use of TypeScript types for asynchronous operations
- Code readability and organization
- Bonus: Implement concurrent task execution with a configurable concurrency limit

## Notes for LLM Instructor
- Emphasize the importance of asynchronous programming in modern web development.
- Use real-world examples to illustrate the benefits of async/await over raw Promises.
- Be prepared to explain the conceptual model of the event loop multiple times.
- When discussing error handling, stress the importance of proper error propagation in asynchronous code.
- Encourage students to think about how these concepts apply to React and Next.js development.
- Be ready to provide additional examples of complex asynchronous flows if needed.
- Remember to relate these concepts back to previous lessons on generics and utility types where applicable.
- Adapt your explanations based on the user's responses and provide additional examples if needed.

# Unit 1, Day 11: Advanced Asynchronous Programming in TypeScript Lesson Plan

## Course Structure Guidelines

This course is delivered by an AI Language Model (LLM) with the following structure:

1. Each day's session lasts approximately 3-4 hours.
2. The LLM breaks down topics into small, manageable chunks.
3. For each chunk:
   a. The LLM presents the information.
   b. Comprehension-check questions are asked to ensure understanding.
   c. The LLM corrects any misunderstandings.
   d. Where relevant, short code submissions are requested from the user.
   e. The LLM provides guidance to improve the user's code.
4. Once per topic, there's a more extensive coding/implementation challenge (about 30 minutes long).
5. The LLM evaluates the user's solution to this challenge.

## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this session, students should be able to:
1. Work with concurrent asynchronous operations
2. Implement and use async iterators and generators
3. Handle complex error scenarios in asynchronous code
4. Understand and use advanced Promise methods
5. Apply TypeScript's advanced types to asynchronous programming

## Content Chunks

### Chunk 1: Concurrent Asynchronous Operations (45 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- `Promise.all()`, `Promise.race()`, `Promise.allSettled()`
- Handling multiple asynchronous operations
- Typing concurrent operations in TypeScript

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. What's the difference between `Promise.all()` and `Promise.allSettled()`?
2. How does TypeScript handle the typing of `Promise.race()`?

#### Practical Task:
Guide the user through implementing a function that fetches data from multiple APIs concurrently and combines the results.

### Chunk 2: Async Iterators and Generators (45 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Introduction to iterators and generators
- Async iterators and for-await-of loops
- Creating async generators
- TypeScript types for async iterators and generators

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. How do async iterators differ from regular iterators?
2. In what scenarios would you use an async generator?

#### Practical Task:
Ask the user to implement an async generator function that yields data from a paginated API.

### Chunk 3: Advanced Error Handling (45 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Implementing retry logic
- Timeouts for asynchronous operations
- Error boundaries in React (brief introduction)
- Creating and using custom error types

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. How would you implement a retry mechanism for a failing asynchronous operation?
2. What are some best practices for error handling in asynchronous TypeScript code?

#### Practical Task:
Guide the user through implementing a robust fetch function with retry logic, timeout, and custom error types.

### Chunk 4: Advanced Promise Methods and Patterns (45 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- `Promise.resolve()` and `Promise.reject()`
- Creating Promises from scratch
- Implementing a simple Promise queue
- The revealing constructor pattern

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. When would you use `Promise.resolve()` or `Promise.reject()`?
2. How can you create a cancelable Promise?

#### Practical Task:
Ask the user to implement a debounce function using Promises and TypeScript.

### Chunk 5: TypeScript's Advanced Types in Asynchronous Programming (30 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Using conditional types with Promises
- Inferring the resolved type of a Promise
- Creating utility types for async functions
- Best practices for typing asynchronous code

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. How can you use TypeScript to infer the resolved type of a Promise?
2. What are some common utility types you might create for working with async functions?

#### Practical Task:
Guide the user through creating advanced utility types for working with asynchronous code, such as a `PromiseReturnType<T>` that extracts the resolved type of a Promise-returning function.

## Extended Coding Challenge (30 minutes)

Create a TypeScript library for managing asynchronous workflows. The library should:

1. Implement a `Task<T>` class representing an asynchronous operation that can be canceled
2. Create a `Workflow` class that can chain multiple `Task<T>` instances together
3. Implement error handling and retry logic for individual tasks
4. Use TypeScript's advanced types to ensure type safety throughout the library
5. Include methods for parallel execution of tasks and proper cancellation propagation

Evaluation Criteria:
- Correct implementation of cancelable tasks and workflows
- Proper use of TypeScript's advanced types
- Effective error handling and retry logic
- Clear and intuitive API design
- Code readability and organization
- Bonus: Implement a simple example of using this library in a React component

## Notes for LLM Instructor
- This lesson covers advanced asynchronous programming concepts. Be prepared to provide multiple explanations and examples.
- Emphasize the practical applications of these concepts in real-world TypeScript and React development.
- When discussing error handling, stress the importance of creating robust, production-ready code.
- Encourage students to think about how these advanced concepts can improve their existing asynchronous code.
- Be prepared to discuss how these concepts apply specifically to Next.js development.
- Use diagrams or flow charts if necessary to explain complex asynchronous flows.
- Remember to tie these concepts back to previous lessons on TypeScript's type system.
- Adapt your explanations based on the user's responses and provide additional examples if needed.

# Unit 1, Day 9: Advanced Generics and Utility Types Lesson Plan

## Course Structure Guidelines

This course is delivered by an AI Language Model (LLM) with the following structure:

1. Each day's session lasts approximately 3-4 hours.
2. The LLM breaks down topics into small, manageable chunks.
3. For each chunk:
   a. The LLM presents the information.
   b. Comprehension-check questions are asked to ensure understanding.
   c. The LLM corrects any misunderstandings.
   d. Where relevant, short code submissions are requested from the user.
   e. The LLM provides guidance to improve the user's code.
4. Once per topic, there's a more extensive coding/implementation challenge (about 30 minutes long).
5. The LLM evaluates the user's solution to this challenge.

## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this session, students should be able to:
1. Implement advanced generic patterns
2. Use conditional types with generics
3. Work with more complex utility types
4. Create advanced custom utility types
5. Apply generics and utility types in practical scenarios

## Content Chunks

### Chunk 1: Advanced Generic Patterns (45 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Generic parameter defaults
- Generic parameter inference
- Higher-order functions with generics
- Recursive generic types

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. When would you use generic parameter defaults?
2. How do recursive generic types work and when are they useful?

#### Practical Task:
Guide the user through creating a generic tree data structure using recursive types.

### Chunk 2: Conditional Types with Generics (45 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Basic conditional types review
- Using conditional types with generics
- Inferring within conditional types
- Distributive conditional types

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. How do conditional types enhance the flexibility of generics?
2. What is the `infer` keyword used for in conditional types?

#### Practical Task:
Ask the user to implement a type that can extract the return type of a function, including handling async functions.

### Chunk 3: Advanced Utility Types (45 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- ReturnType<T> and Parameters<T>
- Exclude<T, U> and Extract<T, U>
- NonNullable<T> and InstanceType<T>
- Readonly<T> and ReadonlyArray<T>

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. How does `ReturnType<T>` work with overloaded functions?
2. What's the difference between `Exclude<T, U>` and `Omit<T, K>`?

#### Practical Task:
Guide the user through refactoring a complex set of function types using these advanced utility types.

### Chunk 4: Creating Advanced Custom Utility Types (45 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Combining conditional types and mapped types
- Creating recursive utility types
- Performance considerations for complex types
- Best practices for custom utility types

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. How can you create a deep version of existing utility types (e.g., `DeepPartial<T>`)?
2. What are some performance considerations when working with complex utility types?

#### Practical Task:
Ask the user to create a `DeepReadonly<T>` utility type that makes all nested properties readonly.

### Chunk 5: Practical Applications in React and Next.js (30 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Using generics with React components
- Typing hooks with generics
- Utility types for prop manipulation
- Next.js specific type utilities (brief introduction)

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. How can generics improve the type safety of React components?
2. What are some common use cases for utility types in React development?

#### Practical Task:
Guide the user through creating a generic React component that uses advanced TypeScript features.

## Extended Coding Challenge (30 minutes)

Create a type-safe form handling system using TypeScript, generics, and utility types. The system should:

1. Define a generic `Form<T>` type that represents the structure of a form
2. Implement a `createForm<T>` function that generates a strongly-typed form object
3. Create utility types for form field validation (`Required<T>`, `MinLength<T, N>`, etc.)
4. Implement a type-safe validation function that works with the created form
5. Use conditional types to create different form behaviors based on field types

Evaluation Criteria:
- Correct use of generics and utility types
- Type-safe implementation of form creation and validation
- Effective use of conditional types for field-specific behavior
- Code readability and organization
- Bonus: Implement a simple React component that uses this form system

## Notes for LLM Instructor
- This lesson covers very advanced TypeScript concepts. Be prepared to explain these concepts multiple times and in different ways.
- Use real-world examples from popular libraries to illustrate how these advanced types are used in practice.
- Emphasize the balance between type safety and code readability/maintainability.
- Be prepared to discuss the performance implications of complex type operations.
- Encourage students to experiment with the TypeScript Playground to understand how these advanced types work.
- When discussing React and Next.js applications, relate back to previous lessons on React development.
- Adapt your explanations based on the user's responses and provide additional examples if needed.

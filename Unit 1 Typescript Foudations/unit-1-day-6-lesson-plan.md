# Unit 1, Day 6: Functions, Objects, and Advanced Types for Personal Blog Application

## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this session, students should be able to:
1. Define and use function types and signatures for blog operations
2. Work with object types and optional properties in blog data structures
3. Implement union and intersection types for diverse blog content
4. Use literal types and type narrowing techniques in blog feature development
5. Begin to grasp advanced type concepts like mapped types for blog data manipulation

## Content Chunks

### Chunk 1: Function Types and Signatures in Blog Operations (45 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Function type expressions for blog post filters and transformations
- Call signatures for comment moderation functions
- Construct signatures for blog post factory functions
- Generic functions for reusable blog utilities

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. How would you define a function type for a blog post filter?
2. What's the benefit of using generic functions in our blog application?

#### Practical Task:
Guide the student through creating various function types for blog operations, including a generic function for paginating different types of blog content.

### Chunk 2: Object Types and Optional Properties in Blog Data (45 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Object type literals for blog posts and comments
- Optional properties for draft posts or user profiles
- Readonly properties for immutable blog data
- Index signatures for flexible metadata on blog posts
- Extending object types for different post types (text, image, video)

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. How can optional properties improve our blog post interface?
2. What's the purpose of an index signature in our blog post metadata?

#### Practical Task:
Ask the student to create a comprehensive object type for a blog post, including optional properties, readonly fields, and an index signature for custom attributes.

### Chunk 3: Union and Intersection Types for Blog Content (45 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Union types for different post statuses or content types
- Intersection types for combining base post types with specific features
- Type narrowing with union types in content rendering
- Discriminated unions for different blog interactions (like, comment, share)

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. When would you use a union type versus an intersection type in our blog application?
2. How can discriminated unions improve our handling of user interactions?

#### Practical Task:
Guide the student through creating a content system using union and intersection types, including a function that uses type narrowing to render different types of blog content.

### Chunk 4: Literal Types and Type Narrowing in Blog Features (45 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- String literal types for predefined blog categories or tags
- Numeric literal types for rating systems
- Boolean literal types for feature flags
- Type narrowing techniques in blog post processing and rendering
- User-defined type guards for custom blog data validation

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. How can literal types enhance type safety in our blog category system?
2. What are different ways to perform type narrowing when handling diverse blog content?

#### Practical Task:
Ask the student to implement a function that takes a union of blog content types and uses various type narrowing techniques to process and display the content appropriately.

### Chunk 5: Introduction to Advanced Type Concepts for Blog Data (30 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Brief overview of mapped types for transforming blog data structures
- The keyof operator for type-safe access to blog post properties
- Conditional types (basic introduction) for advanced blog feature toggles

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. How might mapped types be useful in creating variations of our blog post type?
2. How can the keyof operator improve type safety when accessing blog post properties?

#### Practical Task:
Guide the student through creating a simple mapped type, such as making all properties of a blog post interface optional for a draft post system.

## Extended Coding Challenge (30 minutes)

Create a type-safe blog post creation and management system using TypeScript. The system should:

1. Define a set of blog post types using literal union types (e.g., 'text', 'image', 'video')
2. Create a `BlogPostData` type that maps post types to their corresponding data structures
3. Implement a `BlogManager` class with methods to create posts, list posts, and update post status
4. Use function types to ensure type safety for post creation and update callbacks
5. Implement type narrowing in the post rendering logic

Evaluation Criteria:
- Correct use of union types, literal types, and function types in the blog context
- Proper implementation of type narrowing for different post types
- Type-safe blog post creation and management
- Code readability and organization
- Bonus: Implement a generic constraint to ensure only valid blog post types can be created

## Notes for LLM Instructor
- Emphasize how these advanced types can make the blog application more robust and self-documenting.
- Use real-world blog scenarios to illustrate the practical applications of union types, intersection types, and type narrowing.
- Be prepared to explain type narrowing in detail, as it's crucial for handling different types of blog content.
- When introducing mapped types and conditional types, focus on their basic usage in blog data manipulation.
- Encourage students to think about how these TypeScript features can help prevent bugs in their blog application.
- Adapt explanations based on the student's understanding, providing additional blog-centric examples as needed.

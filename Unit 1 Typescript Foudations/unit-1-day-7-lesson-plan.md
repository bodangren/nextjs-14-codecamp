# Unit 1, Day 7: Advanced Types for Blog Features

## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this session, students should be able to:
1. Implement advanced function types for blog operations
2. Use advanced object types for complex blog data structures
3. Apply union and intersection types to handle different blog post types
4. Utilize literal types and type narrowing for blog categories and tags
5. Understand and implement basic mapped and conditional types for blog data manipulation

## Content Chunks

### Chunk 1: Advanced Function Types for Blog Operations (45 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Function overloads for blog post operations (e.g., create, update)
- 'this' parameters in blog context (e.g., event handlers)
- Rest parameters and spread syntax for flexible blog function arguments
- Parameter destructuring with type annotations for blog data

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. How can function overloads improve our blog post management functions?
2. When would you use 'this' typing in our blog application?

#### Practical Task:
Guide the student through creating a function with overloads for creating different types of blog posts, and another function that uses 'this' typing for a custom event handler in the blog.

### Chunk 2: Advanced Object Types for Blog Data (45 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Record type for blog metadata or tag systems
- Recursive types for nested blog structures (e.g., comments, categories)
- Tuple types for blog post data (e.g., [id, title, date])
- 'unknown' type for handling external blog data

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. How can the Record type be used to improve our blog's tag system?
2. In what scenario might we use recursive types in our blog structure?

#### Practical Task:
Ask the student to create a complex data structure for a nested comment system using recursive types, and implement a tuple type for blog post previews.

### Chunk 3: Union and Intersection Types for Blog Content (45 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Union types for different blog post types (text, image, video)
- Intersection types for combining base post types with additional features
- Discriminated unions for blog interactions (like, comment, share)
- Type narrowing techniques for handling different post types

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. How do union types allow us to handle different blog post types efficiently?
2. When would you use an intersection type in our blog application?

#### Practical Task:
Guide the student through creating a type system for different blog post types using union and intersection types, and implement a function that uses type narrowing to render these posts.

### Chunk 4: Literal Types and Type Narrowing for Blog Features (45 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- String literal types for predefined blog categories or tags
- Numeric literal types for blog post rating systems
- Boolean literal types for blog feature flags
- Type narrowing techniques for blog post processing and rendering

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. How can literal types enhance the type safety of our blog category system?
2. What are different ways to perform type narrowing when handling diverse blog content?

#### Practical Task:
Ask the student to implement a function that takes a union of blog interaction types (like, comment, share) and uses type narrowing to process each interaction appropriately.

### Chunk 5: Introduction to Mapped and Conditional Types for Blog Data (30 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Basic mapped types for transforming blog data structures
- Using keyof with mapped types for type-safe blog post property access
- Simple conditional types for blog feature toggles
- Combining mapped and conditional types for advanced blog data manipulation

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. How might mapped types be useful in creating variations of our blog post type?
2. Can you think of a scenario where conditional types would be helpful in our blog application?

#### Practical Task:
Guide the student through creating a mapped type that makes all properties of a blog post interface optional, and a simple conditional type for toggling features based on user roles.

## Extended Coding Challenge (30 minutes)

Create a type-safe blog post filtering and transformation system using TypeScript. The system should:

1. Define a set of blog post types using union types (e.g., 'text', 'image', 'video')
2. Implement a generic function that can filter blog posts based on various criteria (e.g., category, date, author)
3. Use conditional types to create different views of blog posts (e.g., full view, preview, admin view)
4. Implement type narrowing to handle rendering of different post types
5. Create utility types to extract and transform specific information from blog posts

Evaluation Criteria:
- Correct use of union types, literal types, and function types in the blog context
- Effective implementation of type narrowing for different post types
- Proper use of generic constraints for the filtering function
- Correct implementation of conditional types for post views
- Code readability and organization
- Bonus: Implement a simple mock blog data array to demonstrate the usage of the type system

## Notes for LLM Instructor
- Emphasize how these advanced types can make the blog application more robust and self-documenting.
- Use real-world blog scenarios to illustrate the practical applications of these advanced types.
- Encourage students to think about how these TypeScript features can help prevent bugs in their blog application.
- Be prepared to explain type narrowing in detail, as it's crucial for handling different types of blog content.
- When introducing mapped and conditional types, focus on their basic usage in blog data manipulation, as these will be covered more in-depth in future lessons.
- Adapt explanations based on the student's understanding, providing additional blog-centric examples as needed.

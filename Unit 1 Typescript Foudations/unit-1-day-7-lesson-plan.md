# Unit 1, Day 7: Advanced Type Concepts Lesson Plan

## Course Structure Guidelines

This course is delivered by an AI Language Model (LLM) with the following structure:

1. Each day's session lasts approximately 3-4 hours.
2. The LLM breaks down topics into small, manageable chunks.
3. For each chunk:
   a. The LLM presents the information.
   b. Comprehension-check questions are asked to ensure understanding.
   c. The LLM corrects any misunderstandings.
   d. Where relevant, short code submissions are requested from the user.
   e. The LLM provides guidance to improve the user's code.
4. Once per topic, there's a more extensive coding/implementation challenge (about 30 minutes long).
5. The LLM evaluates the user's solution to this challenge.

## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this session, students should be able to:
1. Understand and implement advanced function types
2. Work with 'this' types in functions
3. Use advanced object type techniques
4. Implement and understand mapped types
5. Create and use conditional types

## Content Chunks

### Chunk 1: Advanced Function Types (45 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Function overloads
- 'this' parameters in functions
- Rest parameters and spread syntax
- Parameter destructuring with type annotations

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. When would you use function overloads in TypeScript?
2. How does TypeScript handle 'this' in function contexts?

#### Practical Task:
Guide the user through creating a function with overloads, and another function that uses 'this' typing and rest parameters.

### Chunk 2: Advanced Object Types (45 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Record type
- Recursive types
- Tuple types in depth (labeled tuples, optional elements)
- 'unknown' type revisited

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. How does the Record type differ from index signatures?
2. When might you use a recursive type?

#### Practical Task:
Ask the user to create a complex data structure using recursive types and tuple types, such as a file system structure or a nested comment system.

### Chunk 3: Mapped Types (45 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Basic mapped types
- Using keyof with mapped types
- Mapped type modifiers (readonly, optional)
- Template literal types with mapped types

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. How do mapped types allow you to create new types based on old ones?
2. What are some practical use cases for mapped types?

#### Practical Task:
Guide the user through creating utility types using mapped types, such as a 'Readonly' type or a 'Partial' type.

### Chunk 4: Conditional Types (45 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Basic conditional types
- Inferring within conditional types
- Distributive conditional types
- Predefined conditional types (Exclude, Extract, NonNullable)

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. How do conditional types work in TypeScript?
2. What's the difference between 'extends' in interfaces and in conditional types?

#### Practical Task:
Ask the user to implement a conditional type that can flatten an array type, and another that can extract the return type of a function.

### Chunk 5: Combining Advanced Types (30 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Using mapped types with conditional types
- Complex type manipulations
- Best practices for advanced type usage

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. How can you combine mapped types and conditional types?
2. When should you use these advanced type features, and when might they be overkill?

#### Practical Task:
Guide the user through creating a complex type manipulation that combines multiple advanced type features.

## Extended Coding Challenge (30 minutes)

Create a type-safe API response handler using TypeScript. The system should:

1. Define a set of API endpoints and their corresponding response types using a mapped type
2. Implement a generic function that can fetch data from any endpoint and return the correct type
3. Use conditional types to handle different response structures (e.g., paginated vs. non-paginated responses)
4. Implement error handling using union types and type narrowing
5. Create utility types to extract specific information from the response types

Evaluation Criteria:
- Correct use of mapped types and conditional types
- Type-safe implementation of the API handler
- Proper error handling and type narrowing
- Effective use of utility types for working with the response data
- Code readability and organization
- Bonus: Implement a simple mock API to demonstrate the usage of the type system

## Notes for LLM Instructor
- This lesson covers very advanced TypeScript concepts. Be prepared to explain these concepts multiple times and in different ways.
- Use real-world examples to illustrate how these advanced types can be used in practical scenarios.
- Emphasize that while these features are powerful, they should be used judiciously to maintain code readability.
- Encourage students to experiment with these types in the TypeScript Playground to see how they work.
- Be prepared to discuss performance implications of complex type operations.
- Remember to relate these concepts back to React and Next.js development where applicable.
- Adapt your explanations based on the user's responses and provide additional examples if needed.

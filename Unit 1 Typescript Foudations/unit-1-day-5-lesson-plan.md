# Unit 1, Day 5: Interfaces and Type Aliases for Personal Blog Application

## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this session, students should be able to:
1. Create and use interfaces for blog-related data structures
2. Implement type aliases for blog data types
3. Understand the differences between interfaces and type aliases in the context of blog development
4. Apply interfaces and type aliases in practical blog development scenarios

## Content Chunks

### Chunk 1: Introduction to Interfaces for Blog Data Structures (30 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- What are interfaces in TypeScript and why are they useful for blog development?
- Syntax for defining basic interfaces
- Creating a simple BlogPost interface

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. What is the purpose of an interface in TypeScript?
2. How might interfaces help us structure our blog's data?

#### Practical Task:
Guide the student through creating a basic `BlogPost` interface with properties like id, title, and content.

### Chunk 2: Advanced Interface Features for Blog Data (30 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Optional properties in interfaces (e.g., subtitle for a blog post)
- Readonly properties (e.g., id for a blog post)
- Extending interfaces (e.g., creating a FeaturedBlogPost interface)

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. When would you use optional properties in our blog interfaces?
2. How does extending interfaces help us create more specific blog post types?

#### Practical Task:
Ask the student to extend the `BlogPost` interface to create a `FeaturedBlogPost` interface with additional properties.

### Chunk 3: Introduction to Type Aliases for Blog Data (30 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- What are type aliases and how do they differ from interfaces?
- Syntax for creating type aliases
- Creating simple type aliases for blog-related data

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. How do type aliases differ from interfaces?
2. When might you use a type alias instead of an interface in our blog application?

#### Practical Task:
Guide the student through creating a type alias for blog post categories (e.g., 'Technology', 'Travel', 'Food').

### Chunk 4: Advanced Type Aliases for Blog Content (30 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Union types for different types of blog content
- Intersection types for combining blog-related types
- Using type aliases with interfaces

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. How can union types be useful for handling different types of blog posts?
2. In what scenario might we use an intersection type in our blog application?

#### Practical Task:
Ask the student to create a union type for different blog content types (text, image, video) and an intersection type combining user data with blog author data.

### Chunk 5: Practical Application in Blog Development (30 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Real-world scenarios for using interfaces and type aliases in the blog application
- Best practices for choosing between interfaces and type aliases
- Common patterns in TypeScript for blog development

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. How might you use interfaces to define the structure of a blog comment system?
2. When working with blog tags, would you use an interface or a type alias? Why?

#### Practical Task:
Guide the student through refactoring a small part of the blog application to use interfaces and type aliases appropriately.

## Extended Practice (30 minutes)

Create a more comprehensive blog post system using TypeScript interfaces and type aliases. The system should include:

1. A `BlogPost` interface with properties like id, title, content, author, publishDate, and tags
2. A type alias for post status ('draft', 'published', 'archived')
3. A `User` interface and an extended `BlogAuthor` interface
4. A union type for different types of blog content (text, image, video)

Encourage the student to think about how these types would be used in a real blog application, but do not require implementation of functions or classes.

Evaluation Criteria:
- Correct use of interfaces and type aliases for blog-related data
- Appropriate use of advanced features like optional properties and extending interfaces
- Effective use of union types for different content types
- Logical organization of types that reflects a real-world blog structure

## Notes for LLM Instructor
- Focus on the structure and typing of blog-related data, avoiding function implementations or class creation.
- Use concrete examples from blog development to illustrate each concept.
- Encourage students to think about how these TypeScript features can improve their blog's code organization.
- Be prepared to explain the nuances between interfaces and type aliases in the context of blog development.
- Adapt explanations based on the student's understanding, providing additional blog-centric examples as needed.
- Remember that students haven't covered functions or classes in TypeScript yet, so avoid tasks that require these concepts.

# Unit 1: TypeScript Foundations

## Course Structure Guidelines

This course is delivered by an AI Language Model (LLM) with the following structure:

1. Each day's session lasts approximately 3-4 hours.
2. The LLM breaks down topics into small, manageable chunks.
3. For each chunk:
   a. The LLM presents the information.
   b. Comprehension-check questions are asked to ensure understanding.
   c. The LLM corrects any misunderstandings.
   d. Where relevant, short code submissions are requested from the user.
   e. The LLM provides guidance to improve the user's code.
4. Once per topic, there's a more extensive coding/implementation challenge (about 30 minutes long).
5. The LLM evaluates the user's solution to this challenge.

## Unit Overview
This unit focuses on building a strong foundation in TypeScript, preparing students for developing robust Next.js applications. Over the course of 8 days, students will learn about TypeScript basics, advanced types, generics, and asynchronous programming in TypeScript.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this unit, students should be able to:
1. Understand and use TypeScript's basic and advanced types
2. Write and use interfaces and type aliases
3. Implement and use generics in TypeScript
4. Understand and use utility types
5. Write asynchronous code using TypeScript

## Daily Breakdown

### Day 4-5: TypeScript basics (types, interfaces, type inference)
- Introduction to TypeScript
- Basic types (number, string, boolean, array, tuple, enum, any, void, null, undefined)
- Type inference and type annotations
- Interfaces and type aliases

### Day 6-7: Functions, objects, and advanced types
- Function types and signatures
- Object types and optional properties
- Union and intersection types
- Literal types and type narrowing
- Advanced type concepts (mapped types, conditional types)

### Day 8-9: Generics and utility types
- Introduction to generics
- Generic functions and classes
- Generic constraints
- Built-in utility types (Partial, Required, Pick, Omit, etc.)
- Creating custom utility types

### Day 10-11: Asynchronous programming in TypeScript
- Promises in TypeScript
- Async/await syntax
- Error handling in asynchronous code
- TypeScript with APIs and fetch

## Unit Challenge
At the end of this unit, students will complete a challenge that involves creating a small TypeScript library that demonstrates their understanding of various TypeScript concepts, including generics, utility types, and asynchronous programming.

## Notes for LLM Instructor
- Emphasize the benefits of TypeScript in catching errors early and improving code quality.
- Use real-world examples to illustrate the practical applications of TypeScript concepts.
- Encourage students to experiment with TypeScript in the online playground.
- Be prepared to explain complex type manipulations step-by-step.
- Remember to relate TypeScript concepts back to their use in Next.js development.

# Unit 4, Day 30: Next.js 14 Project Structure and Advanced Configuration Lesson Plan

## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this session, students should be able to:
1. Understand and implement advanced App Router concepts
2. Manage and organize project assets effectively
3. Implement and use environment variables in Next.js 14
4. Configure and optimize Next.js 14 for different deployment environments

## Content Chunks

### Chunk 1: Advanced App Router Concepts (60 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Implementing dynamic routes with the App Router
- Using route groups for organizational purposes
- Creating and using layout groups
- Implementing parallel routes and intercepting routes

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. How do dynamic routes work in the App Router, and how do they differ from static routes?
2. What are the benefits of using route groups in a Next.js 14 project?

#### Practical Task:
Guide the user through creating a multi-section website with dynamic routes, route groups, and a parallel route for a dashboard-like interface.

### Chunk 2: Managing Project Assets and Styles (45 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Organizing and importing CSS in Next.js 14 projects
- Using the public directory for static assets
- Implementing and using CSS Modules
- Introduction to built-in CSS support and CSS-in-JS options

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. What is the purpose of the public directory in a Next.js 14 project?
2. How do CSS Modules help in creating scoped styles for components?

#### Practical Task:
Ask the user to refactor the styling of their portfolio project from Day 29, implementing CSS Modules and organizing static assets in the public directory.

### Chunk 3: Environment Variables and Configuration (45 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Understanding environment variables in Next.js 14
- Setting up and using .env files
- Exposing environment variables to the browser
- Best practices for managing sensitive information

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. How can you use environment variables in both server-side and client-side code in Next.js 14?
2. What are the security considerations when exposing environment variables to the browser?

#### Practical Task:
Guide the user through setting up environment variables for different environments (development, staging, production) and using them in their Next.js 14 application.

### Chunk 4: Advanced Configuration and Optimization (60 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Deep dive into next.config.js options
- Configuring build output and optimization settings
- Setting up custom webpack configurations
- Implementing and using Next.js plugins

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. What are some common use cases for customizing the webpack configuration in Next.js 14?
2. How can you optimize the build output for different deployment environments?

#### Practical Task:
Ask the user to implement custom webpack configuration to add support for a specific file type, and optimize their Next.js 14 application for production deployment.

## Extended Coding Challenge (90 minutes)

Extend the "Next.js 14 Portfolio Starter" project from Day 29 to create a more advanced "Next.js 14 Personal Blog" application. The project should include:

1. A home page with featured blog posts
2. A blog index page with pagination
3. Dynamic routes for individual blog posts
4. A category system with filtered post lists
5. An about page and a contact form
6. Optimized images using the Next.js Image component
7. Environment variable usage for API keys or external service configurations
8. Custom 404 and 500 error pages

The project should demonstrate:
- Advanced use of the App Router, including dynamic and catch-all routes
- Effective use of layouts and nested layouts
- Implementation of CSS Modules for styling
- Proper management of environment variables
- Optimized configuration for production deployment

Evaluation Criteria:
- Correct implementation of advanced App Router features
- Proper use of TypeScript for improved type safety
- Effective organization of project assets and styles
- Correct usage of environment variables and configuration
- Optimized build output for production
- Clean, organized, and maintainable code structure
- Improved user experience with optimized images and error handling

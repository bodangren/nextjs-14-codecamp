## Content Chunks

### Chunk 1: Advanced Patterns with Server Components (60 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Composing Server and Client Components effectively
- Implementing nested layouts with Server Components
- Using Server Components for code splitting and lazy loading
- Handling SEO with Server Components

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. How can Server Components be used to implement efficient code splitting in Next.js 14?
2. What are the advantages of using Server Components for SEO in Next.js 14?

#### Practical Task:
Guide the user through refactoring a complex page to use a mixture of Server and Client Components for optimal performance and SEO.

### Chunk 2: Optimizing Data Fetching and Caching (60 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Implementing parallel data fetching with Server Components
- Using React's cache function for memoization in Server Components
- Implementing and using React's new fetch API in Server Components
- Strategies for revalidating and updating cached data

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. How does parallel data fetching in Server Components improve application performance?
2. What is the purpose of the cache function in Server Components, and how is it used?

#### Practical Task:
Ask the user to implement a Server Component that fetches data from multiple sources in parallel and applies appropriate caching strategies.

### Chunk 3: State Management with Server and Client Components (45 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Managing local state in Client Components
- Implementing forms with Server Components
- Using Server Actions for form submissions
- Strategies for sharing state between Server and Client Components

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. How do you handle form submissions when using Server Components?
2. What are the challenges in sharing state between Server and Client Components, and how can they be addressed?

#### Practical Task:
Guide the user through creating a form that uses Server Components for rendering and Server Actions for handling submissions, with real-time validation in a Client Component.

### Chunk 4: Server-Side Form Handling and Validation (45 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Implementing server-side form validation in Next.js 14
- Using zod or other validation libraries with Server Components
- Handling file uploads with Server Components
- Implementing CSRF protection in server-side form handling

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. What are the advantages of server-side form validation in Next.js 14?
2. How can you implement file uploads using Server Components?

#### Practical Task:
Ask the user to create a multi-step form with server-side validation, including file upload functionality and CSRF protection.

## Extended Coding Challenge (90 minutes)

Create a "Next.js 14 E-commerce Product Management System" that demonstrates advanced use of Server Components. The project should include:

1. A product listing page with server-side pagination and filtering
2. A product detail page with nested layouts for product information, reviews, and related items
3. An admin interface for adding and editing products, using Server Components and Server Actions
4. A search feature with server-side processing and client-side UI
5. An image upload system for product photos using Server Components
6. Implementation of caching strategies for product data
7. SEO optimization using Server Components

The project should demonstrate:
- Advanced composition of Server and Client Components
- Efficient data fetching and caching strategies
- Server-side form handling and validation
- Effective use of Server Actions
- SEO optimization techniques
- TypeScript for type-safe component and data handling

Evaluation Criteria:
- Correct implementation of advanced Server Component patterns
- Efficient data fetching and caching strategies
- Proper handling of forms and file uploads on the server
- Effective use of Server Actions for data mutations
- Implementation of SEO best practices using Server Components
- Clean separation of concerns between server and client code
- Proper error handling and loading state management
- Correct usage of TypeScript for enhanced type safety

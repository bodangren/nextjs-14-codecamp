# Unit 4, Day 37: API Routes and Serverless Functions in Next.js 14 Lesson Plan

## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this session, students should be able to:
1. Understand the concept and benefits of API routes in Next.js 14
2. Create and implement API routes using the App Router
3. Handle different HTTP methods in API routes
4. Implement error handling and validation in API routes
5. Understand the basics of serverless functions and their relation to API routes

## Content Chunks

### Chunk 1: Introduction to API Routes in Next.js 14 (45 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Concept of API routes and their role in Next.js applications
- Differences between API routes in Pages Router vs App Router
- Benefits of using API routes (serverless, full-stack JavaScript, etc.)
- Basic structure of an API route in Next.js 14

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. What are the main benefits of using API routes in a Next.js 14 application?
2. How do API routes in the App Router differ from those in the Pages Router?

#### Practical Task:
Guide the user through creating a simple API route that returns a JSON response, and test it using a tool like Postman or the browser.

### Chunk 2: Handling HTTP Methods in API Routes (60 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Implementing GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE methods in API routes
- Using the Request and Response objects in API routes
- Parsing query parameters and request bodies
- Implementing route handlers for different HTTP methods

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. How do you handle different HTTP methods in a single API route?
2. What's the difference between query parameters and request body, and how do you access each in an API route?

#### Practical Task:
Ask the user to create a CRUD API for a simple resource (e.g., todos), implementing all four main HTTP methods.

### Chunk 3: Error Handling and Validation in API Routes (45 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Implementing proper error handling in API routes
- Using try/catch blocks for async operations
- Sending appropriate status codes and error messages
- Implementing input validation using libraries like Zod

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. Why is proper error handling important in API routes?
2. How can you use Zod to validate input in your API routes?

#### Practical Task:
Guide the user through adding error handling and input validation to the CRUD API created in the previous task.

### Chunk 4: Serverless Functions and API Routes (60 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Concept of serverless functions and their benefits
- How API routes in Next.js 14 relate to serverless functions
- Deploying API routes as serverless functions (e.g., on Vercel)
- Best practices for serverless function development

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. What are the advantages of using serverless functions for API development?
2. How does Next.js 14 facilitate the development and deployment of serverless functions?

#### Practical Task:
Ask the user to create a serverless function that interacts with an external API (e.g., fetching weather data) and deploy it to a platform like Vercel.

## Extended Coding Challenge (90 minutes)

Create a "Next.js 14 Bookstore API" that demonstrates the use of API routes and serverless functions. The project should include:

1. CRUD operations for books (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
2. User authentication using JWT tokens
3. Input validation using Zod
4. Error handling with appropriate status codes and messages
5. A rate limiting middleware for API routes
6. Integration with an external API (e.g., Google Books API for book information)
7. Serverless functions for processing book orders

The project should demonstrate:
- Effective use of API routes in Next.js 14
- Proper handling of different HTTP methods
- Implementation of authentication and authorization
- Input validation and error handling
- Use of serverless functions for specific tasks
- Integration with external APIs
- TypeScript for type-safe API development

Evaluation Criteria:
- Correct implementation of CRUD operations using API routes
- Proper authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Effective input validation and error handling
- Appropriate use of serverless functions
- Implementation of rate limiting for API protection
- Clean, efficient, and well-organized code structure
- Correct usage of TypeScript for enhanced type safety

## Notes for LLM Instructor
- Emphasize the power and flexibility of API routes in creating full-stack applications with Next.js 14
- Use real-world examples to illustrate the benefits of serverless architecture
- Guide students through best practices for API design and implementation
- Be prepared to explain the security implications of API routes and how to protect them
- Encourage students to think about scalability and performance when designing API routes
- Provide tips on testing API routes and serverless functions
- Adapt explanations based on the user's responses and provide additional examples if needed
- Reinforce the importance of type safety with TypeScript in API development

## Extended Coding Challenge (90 minutes)

Create a "Next.js 14 SEO-Optimized Multi-language Portfolio" that demonstrates comprehensive SEO techniques and serves as a capstone project for the unit. The project should include:

1. A home page with optimized metadata, structured data, and internationalization
2. Project showcase pages with dynamic metadata and structured data
3. A blog section with SEO-optimized content and pagination
4. Internationalization support for at least two languages
5. Optimized images and fonts for Core Web Vitals
6. A dynamically generated sitemap and optimized robots.txt
7. Breadcrumb navigation throughout the site
8. Implementation of Google Analytics or a similar tool for performance tracking

The project should demonstrate:
- Effective use of all SEO techniques learned throughout the unit
- Proper internationalization implementation with SEO considerations
- Optimization for Core Web Vitals
- Use of Server Components and other Next.js 14 features for optimal performance
- TypeScript for type-safe development

Evaluation Criteria:

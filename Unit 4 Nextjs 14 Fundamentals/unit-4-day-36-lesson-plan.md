## Content Chunks

### Chunk 1: Advanced Server Component Data Fetching (60 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Fetching data in nested Server Components
- Implementing waterfall and parallel data fetching
- Using React's cache() function for request memoization
- Handling cookies and headers in Server Component data fetching

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. How does nested data fetching in Server Components affect application performance?
2. What is the purpose of the cache() function, and how does it optimize data fetching?

#### Practical Task:
Guide the user through refactoring a nested component structure to use parallel data fetching with Server Components, implementing caching for optimal performance.

### Chunk 2: Caching Strategies and Revalidation (60 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Understanding Next.js 14's caching mechanisms
- Implementing time-based revalidation
- On-demand revalidation techniques
- Combining different caching strategies for optimal performance

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. How does Next.js 14 handle caching in Server Components?
2. In what scenarios would you use on-demand revalidation over time-based revalidation?

#### Practical Task:
Ask the user to implement a caching strategy for a product catalog, including time-based revalidation for product lists and on-demand revalidation for individual product updates.

### Chunk 3: React Suspense and Streaming (45 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Understanding React Suspense in the context of Next.js 14
- Implementing Suspense boundaries for improved loading experiences
- Utilizing streaming with Suspense for faster page loads
- Handling errors with Error Boundaries in Suspense-enabled components

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. How does React Suspense improve the user experience in data fetching scenarios?
2. What is streaming in Next.js 14, and how does it relate to Suspense?

#### Practical Task:
Guide the user through implementing a Suspense-enabled page with multiple data fetching components, including streaming for improved performance.

### Chunk 4: Real-time Data Updates (45 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Implementing real-time updates using Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- Utilizing WebSockets for real-time bidirectional communication
- Combining Server Components with client-side real-time updates
- Optimizing real-time data flow for performance

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. When would you choose SSE over WebSockets for real-time updates?
2. How can Server Components be used effectively with real-time data updates?

#### Practical Task:
Ask the user to implement a real-time chat feature using WebSockets, integrating it with Server Components for optimal performance.

## Extended Coding Challenge (90 minutes)

Create a "Next.js 14 Real-time Dashboard" that demonstrates advanced data fetching and optimization techniques. The project should include:

1. A main dashboard with multiple widgets fetching data in parallel
2. Real-time stock price updates using Server-Sent Events
3. A lazy-loaded chart component with Suspense for improved loading
4. A search feature with debounced API calls and caching
5. A news feed with infinite scrolling and incremental static regeneration
6. A user profile section with on-demand revalidation
7. Error boundaries for graceful error handling

The project should demonstrate:
- Efficient parallel data fetching with Server Components
- Effective use of caching strategies and revalidation
- Implementation of React Suspense for improved UX
- Real-time data updates using SSE or WebSockets
- Lazy loading and code splitting for performance
- TypeScript for type-safe data fetching and component props

Evaluation Criteria:
- Correct implementation of advanced data fetching techniques
- Appropriate use of caching and revalidation strategies
- Effective integration of React Suspense and streaming
- Implementation of real-time updates with good performance
- Proper error handling and loading state management
- Clean, efficient, and well-organized code structure
- Correct usage of TypeScript for enhanced type safety

- Perform CRUD operations with Firestore
- Understand data modeling and querying in Firestore
- Explore Cloud SQL as an alternative database solution
- Integrate Cloud SQL with Next.js 14 applications

## Key Topics
- Firestore setup and configuration
- CRUD operations with Firestore
- Data modeling and querying in Firestore
- Introduction to Cloud SQL

1. Optimize Cloud SQL queries for performance
2. Implement advanced SQL features (views, stored procedures, triggers)
3. Design and implement database sharding strategies
4. Use Cloud SQL with serverless and edge computing in Next.js

## Content Chunks

### Chunk 1: Query Optimization and Performance Tuning (60 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Understanding query execution plans
- Indexing strategies for performance
- Query optimization techniques (JOIN optimizations, subquery optimizations)
- Caching strategies with Cloud SQL
- Monitoring and profiling SQL queries

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. How can you determine if a query needs optimization?
2. What are some common techniques for optimizing complex JOIN operations?

#### Practical Task:
Guide the user through optimizing queries in their Task Board application. They should analyze query performance, create appropriate indexes, and refactor any inefficient queries.

### Chunk 2: Advanced SQL Features (45 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Creating and using views
- Implementing stored procedures
- Designing and using triggers
- Partitioning large tables
- Using transactions for data integrity

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. In what scenarios would you use a view instead of a regular table?
2. How can triggers be useful in maintaining data consistency?

#### Practical Task:
Ask the user to implement an advanced feature in their Task Board using these SQL concepts. For example, they could create a view for task analytics, a stored procedure for assigning tasks, and a trigger for logging task status changes.

### Chunk 3: Scaling Cloud SQL (60 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Vertical vs horizontal scaling in Cloud SQL
- Implementing read replicas
- Database sharding strategies
- Handling database failover
- Load balancing database connections

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. When would you choose to implement database sharding?
2. How do read replicas improve database performance and reliability?

#### Practical Task:
Guide the user through designing a scaling strategy for their Task Board application. They should plan for horizontal scaling using sharding based on team or board ID, and set up a read replica for improved read performance.

### Chunk 4: Cloud SQL in Serverless and Edge Environments (45 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Using Cloud SQL with serverless functions
- Implementing connection pooling in serverless environments
- Strategies for reducing cold start times
- Using Cloud SQL with Next.js API routes and server-side rendering
- Considerations for edge computing with SQL databases

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. What are the challenges of using Cloud SQL in a serverless environment?
2. How can you optimize database connections in Next.js API routes?

#### Practical Task:
Ask the user to refactor part of their Task Board to use serverless functions (e.g., Cloud Functions) for certain database operations. They should implement proper connection pooling and optimize for performance.

### Chunk 5: Cloud SQL vs Firestore: Choosing the Right Database (60 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Comparing performance characteristics of Cloud SQL and Firestore
- Scalability considerations for each database type
- Cost analysis: Cloud SQL vs Firestore
- Use cases best suited for SQL vs NoSQL
- Designing hybrid architectures using both databases

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. In what scenarios would Firestore be a better choice than Cloud SQL, and vice versa?
2. How can you leverage the strengths of both SQL and NoSQL in a single application?

#### Practical Task:
Guide the user through analyzing their Task Board application and determining which parts would be best served by Cloud SQL vs Firestore. They should design a hybrid architecture that uses both databases optimally.

## Extended Coding Challenge (90 minutes)

Enhance the "Real-time Collaborative Task Board" application with advanced database features:

1. Implement query optimization for all Cloud SQL queries, using appropriate indexes and query refactoring
2. Create a view for task analytics and a stored procedure for bulk task assignment
3. Design and implement a sharding strategy for the Cloud SQL database to handle high load
4. Refactor a portion of the application to use serverless functions for database operations
5. Implement a hybrid architecture where Cloud SQL is used for structured data and complex queries, while Firestore is used for real-time features
6. Add a new feature that leverages the strengths of both databases (e.g., real-time collaborative editing with versioning)
7. Implement proper security measures for both Cloud SQL and Firestore in a production environment

The project should demonstrate:
- Effective query optimization and use of advanced SQL features
- Implementation of a scalable database architecture
- Proper use of serverless functions with SQL databases
- Thoughtful division of functionality between SQL and NoSQL databases
- Consideration of performance, scalability, and cost in database design

Evaluation Criteria:
- Evidence of query optimization and effective use of indexes
- Successful implementation of advanced SQL features (views, stored procedures)
- Design and partial implementation of a database scaling strategy
- Effective use of serverless functions for database operations
- Appropriate division of functionality between Cloud SQL and Firestore
- Implementation of a feature showcasing the strengths of both databases
- Consideration of security in database access and operations
- Clean, efficient, and well-organized code structure
- Appropriate use of TypeScript for type safety
- Justification of database choices based on application requirements

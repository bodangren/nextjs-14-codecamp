## Content Chunks

### Chunk 1: Advanced Querying Techniques (60 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Complex queries using compound conditions
- Array-contains and array-contains-any queries
- Implementing full-text search in Firestore
- Geospatial queries in Firestore
- Querying on multiple collections (collection group queries)

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. How would you implement a search feature that looks for partial matches in multiple fields?
2. What are the limitations of array queries in Firestore, and how can you work around them?

#### Practical Task:
Guide the user through implementing an advanced search feature in their Task Board. They should create a search that looks for partial matches in task titles and descriptions, allows filtering by multiple tags (stored as an array), and can search across all boards a user has access to.

### Chunk 2: Query Optimization and Indexing (45 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Understanding Firestore's query execution
- Creating and managing composite indexes
- Index merging and exemptions
- Query cursors for efficient pagination
- Optimizing queries for aggregations

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. When would you need to create a composite index in Firestore?
2. How can query cursors improve the performance of paginated queries?

#### Practical Task:
Ask the user to optimize the queries in their Task Board for performance. They should identify queries that require composite indexes, implement them, and use query cursors for efficient pagination of task lists.

### Chunk 3: Scalability Considerations (60 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Designing for high read/write throughput
- Sharding strategies for large collections
- Handling hot spots in Firestore
- Scalable counter patterns
- Firestore quotas and limits

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. What strategies can you use to avoid hot spots in a Firestore database?
2. How would you implement a scalable counter for a feature that might have very high write volume?

#### Practical Task:
Guide the user through implementing a scalable activity feed for their Task Board. They should design a system that can handle high write volume (e.g., for task updates) and allow efficient reading of recent activities across multiple boards and teams.

### Chunk 4: Real-time Data and Listeners (45 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Efficient use of real-time listeners
- Handling large result sets with real-time queries
- Implementing presence indicators
- Managing listener attachments and detachments
- Optimizing for real-time synchronization across clients

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. What are the potential pitfalls of using real-time listeners, and how can you mitigate them?
2. How would you implement a feature showing which users are currently viewing a task?

#### Practical Task:
Ask the user to implement real-time collaboration features in their Task Board. They should add real-time updates for task changes, a presence system showing active users on a board, and ensure these features scale well with many simultaneous users.

### Chunk 5: Cost Optimization and Best Practices (60 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Understanding Firestore's pricing model
- Strategies for reducing read/write operations
- Efficient data bundling for initial app load
- Caching strategies to minimize Firestore usage
- Best practices for Firestore in production environments

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. How can you optimize your Firestore usage to minimize costs in a production environment?
2. What strategies can you employ to reduce the number of read operations in a Firestore-based application?

#### Practical Task:
Guide the user through optimizing their Task Board for cost-effectiveness. They should implement caching strategies, optimize their use of real-time listeners, and use efficient data bundling for the initial app load.

## Extended Coding Challenge (90 minutes)

Enhance the "Real-time Collaborative Task Board" application with advanced querying and scalability features:

1. Implement an advanced search feature with partial matching and filtering capabilities
2. Create an activity feed that efficiently handles high write volume and real-time updates
3. Implement infinite scrolling for task lists using query cursors
4. Add a presence system showing active users on each board
5. Optimize the application to efficiently handle boards with thousands of tasks
6. Implement a caching strategy to minimize Firestore reads and optimize for cost
7. Add a simple analytics dashboard that aggregates data across all boards and users

The project should demonstrate:
- Effective use of advanced Firestore querying techniques
- Implementation of scalable data access patterns
- Efficient use of real-time listeners
- Optimization for high read/write throughput
- Consideration of cost-effectiveness in Firestore usage

Evaluation Criteria:
- Successful implementation of advanced search functionality
- Scalable design of activity feed and analytics features
- Efficient implementation of infinite scrolling
- Effective use of real-time features including presence system
- Evidence of performance optimization for large data sets
- Implementation of caching and cost optimization strategies
- Clean, efficient, and well-organized code structure
- Appropriate use of TypeScript for type safety
- Consideration of security and privacy in feature implementation

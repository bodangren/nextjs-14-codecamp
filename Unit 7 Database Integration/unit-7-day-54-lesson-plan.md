# Unit 7, Day 54: Advanced CRUD Operations in Firestore with Next.js 14 Lesson Plan

## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this session, students should be able to:
1. Implement advanced create operations with custom document IDs and server timestamps
2. Perform complex read operations using composite queries and collection group queries
3. Execute advanced update operations including field updates and array operations
4. Implement soft delete and hard delete strategies
5. Use Firestore with Next.js API routes for server-side operations
6. Implement optimistic updates for a better user experience

## Content Chunks

### Chunk 1: Advanced Create Operations (60 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Creating documents with custom IDs vs auto-generated IDs
- Using server timestamps for create and update times
- Implementing atomic operations during document creation
- Handling unique constraints in Firestore
- Best practices for structuring data during creation

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. When would you use a custom document ID instead of an auto-generated one?
2. How can server timestamps ensure consistency across clients?

#### Practical Task:
Guide the user through enhancing the task creation process in their Task Board application. Implement custom IDs based on the task title, use server timestamps for created and updated fields, and ensure unique constraints for task titles within a board.

### Chunk 2: Complex Read Operations (45 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Implementing composite queries with multiple conditions
- Using collection group queries for searching across subcollections
- Querying based on the existence (or absence) of a field
- Implementing full-text search in Firestore (limitations and workarounds)
- Optimizing read operations for large datasets

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. What are the limitations of composite queries in Firestore, and how can you work around them?
2. In what scenarios would you use a collection group query?

#### Practical Task:
Ask the user to implement an advanced search functionality for their Task Board, allowing users to search for tasks across all boards using multiple criteria (e.g., title, description, assigned user, and date range).

### Chunk 3: Advanced Update Operations (60 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Updating specific fields in a document
- Implementing atomic increment/decrement operations
- Array operations: union, remove, and array-contains filters
- Conditional updates using preconditions
- Handling concurrent updates and conflict resolution

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. How do atomic operations help in managing concurrent updates?
2. What are the different array operations available in Firestore, and when would you use each?

#### Practical Task:
Guide the user through implementing advanced update operations in their Task Board. This should include incrementing a task's priority, adding/removing tags using array operations, and implementing a version control system to handle concurrent edits.

### Chunk 4: Delete Strategies and Data Lifecycle (45 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Implementing soft delete vs. hard delete
- Cascading deletes for related documents
- Using Cloud Functions for complex delete operations
- Data archiving strategies
- Implementing data retention policies

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. What are the pros and cons of soft delete vs. hard delete?
2. How can you implement cascading deletes in Firestore?

#### Practical Task:
Ask the user to implement both soft delete and hard delete options for tasks in their Task Board. Then, implement a cascading delete for when a board is deleted, ensuring all related tasks are also removed.

### Chunk 5: Server-Side Operations and Optimistic Updates (60 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Implementing CRUD operations in Next.js API routes
- Securing server-side Firestore operations
- Optimistic updates: concept and implementation
- Handling failures in optimistic updates
- Balancing between client-side and server-side operations

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. What are the advantages of performing Firestore operations server-side?
2. How does optimistic updating improve user experience, and what are its potential pitfalls?

#### Practical Task:
Guide the user through moving some of their Firestore operations to Next.js API routes for better security. Then, implement optimistic updates for task status changes to improve the user experience.

## Extended Coding Challenge (90 minutes)

Enhance the "Real-time Collaborative Task Board" application with advanced CRUD operations:

1. Implement custom IDs and server timestamps for all task operations
2. Create an advanced search functionality that works across all boards
3. Add a tagging system for tasks, using Firestore array operations
4. Implement both soft delete and hard delete options for tasks, with cascading deletes for boards
5. Move complex operations to Next.js API routes, ensuring proper security
6. Implement optimistic updates for task changes (creation, update, delete)
7. Add a conflict resolution system for concurrent task edits

The project should demonstrate:
- Effective use of advanced Firestore CRUD operations
- Implementation of complex querying and search functionality
- Proper handling of data lifecycle (creation, updates, deletion, archiving)
- Balanced use of client-side and server-side operations
- Implementation of optimistic updates for improved UX

Evaluation Criteria:
- Correct implementation of advanced Firestore CRUD operations
- Effective use of server timestamps and custom IDs
- Robust search functionality across the application
- Proper implementation of soft delete and cascading deletes
- Secure implementation of server-side operations in Next.js API routes
- Smooth user experience with optimistic updates
- Proper error handling and conflict resolution
- Clean, efficient, and well-organized code structure
- Appropriate use of TypeScript for type safety

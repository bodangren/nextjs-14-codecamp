# Unit 7: Database Integration

## Overview
This unit introduces students to database integration in Next.js applications, focusing on Firestore and Cloud SQL. Students will learn how to set up, interact with, and optimize these databases in the context of a Next.js project.

## Learning Objectives
- Set up and configure Firestore and Cloud SQL for use with Next.js
- Implement CRUD operations using Firestore and Cloud SQL
- Design efficient data models for NoSQL (Firestore) and SQL databases
- Implement data validation and security rules
- Optimize database queries for performance
- Handle real-time data with Firestore
- Implement data migration strategies
- Apply best practices for database integration in Next.js applications

## Key Topics
- Firestore setup and configuration
- Cloud SQL setup and configuration
- CRUD operations in Firestore and Cloud SQL
- Data modeling for NoSQL and SQL databases
- Firestore security rules
- Real-time data synchronization with Firestore
- Query optimization and indexing
- Data migration between Firestore and Cloud SQL
- Error handling and data validation
- Performance considerations in database operations

## Daily Breakdown

### Day 52-53: Introduction to Firestore
- **Main concepts to cover**:
  - Setting up a Firestore project and configuring it for web
  - Firestore data model (collections and documents)
  - Basic CRUD operations with Firestore
  - Firestore security rules
  - Real-time data synchronization
- **Practical tasks**:
  - Set up a Firestore project
  - Implement basic CRUD operations in a Next.js application
  - Create Firestore security rules
  - Implement real-time data updates

### Day 54-55: Advanced Firestore and CRUD Operations
- **Main concepts to cover**:
  - Complex queries and data filtering
  - Batch operations and transactions
  - Implementing pagination
  - Error handling and data validation
  - Optimizing Firestore for performance
- **Practical tasks**:
  - Implement complex queries and filtering
  - Create a paginated list of items
  - Implement batch write operations
  - Add error handling and data validation to CRUD operations
  - Optimize queries using indexes

### Day 56-57: Data Modeling in Firestore
- **Main concepts to cover**:
  - NoSQL data modeling principles
  - Designing efficient Firestore data models
  - Handling relationships in Firestore
  - Denormalization and data duplication strategies
  - Modeling for scalability and performance
- **Practical tasks**:
  - Design a data model for a complex application
  - Implement the designed data model in Firestore
  - Create queries to efficiently retrieve related data
  - Implement a strategy for keeping denormalized data in sync

### Day 58-59: Introduction to Cloud SQL
- **Main concepts to cover**:
  - Setting up a Cloud SQL instance
  - Connecting Cloud SQL to a Next.js application
  - Basic SQL operations (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
  - Implementing an ORM (Prisma) with Cloud SQL
  - Comparison between Firestore and Cloud SQL use cases
- **Practical tasks**:
  - Set up a Cloud SQL instance
  - Connect Cloud SQL to a Next.js application
  - Implement basic CRUD operations using raw SQL and an ORM
  - Migrate a portion of the application data from Firestore to Cloud SQL
  - Implement a strategy for using both Firestore and Cloud SQL in the same application

## Unit Challenge
Build a "Next.js Application with Dual Database Integration" that includes:
- A Firestore database for real-time data (e.g., chat messages, live updates)
- A Cloud SQL database for structured, relational data (e.g., user profiles, product catalog)
- CRUD operations for both databases
- Real-time updates using Firestore
- Complex queries and pagination using both databases
- Data validation and error handling
- A simple admin interface for managing data in both databases
- A data migration script to move data between Firestore and Cloud SQL
- Optimized queries and proper indexing for both databases

### Evaluation criteria:
- Successful integration of both Firestore and Cloud SQL with a Next.js application
- Implementation of efficient CRUD operations for both databases
- Proper use of Firestore for real-time data and Cloud SQL for relational data
- Implementation of security measures (Firestore security rules, SQL injection prevention)
- Efficient data modeling in both NoSQL and SQL contexts
- Use of TypeScript for type safety in database-related code
- Implementation of error handling and data validation
- Evidence of query optimization and proper indexing
- Clean and organized code with proper separation of concerns
- Presence of data migration strategy between the two databases

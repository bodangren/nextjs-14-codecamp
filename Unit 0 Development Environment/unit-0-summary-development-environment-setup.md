# Unit 0: Development Environment Setup - Summary

## Overview
This unit focused on setting up a robust development environment for Next.js 14 with React, TypeScript, and GCP development. It covered essential tools and technologies over the course of 3 days (Days 1-3 of the overall course), laying the groundwork for efficient coding, debugging, and collaboration throughout the course and in real-world projects.

## Key Learning Objectives
By the end of this unit, students should be able to:
1. Set up and customize Visual Studio Code for efficient React and TypeScript development
2. Understand and implement version control using Git and GitHub
3. Install and configure Node.js and npm for Next.js development
4. Initialize a basic Next.js project with TypeScript

# Unit 0, Day 1: VSCode Setup Lesson Plan

## Course Structure Guidelines

This course is delivered by an AI Language Model (LLM) with the following structure:

1. Each day's session lasts approximately 3-4 hours.
2. The LLM breaks down topics into small, manageable chunks.
3. For each chunk:
   a. The LLM presents the information.
   b. Comprehension-check questions are asked to ensure understanding.
   c. The LLM corrects any misunderstandings.
   d. Where relevant, short code submissions are requested from the user.
   e. The LLM provides guidance to improve the user's code.
4. Once per topic, there's a more extensive coding/implementation challenge (about 30 minutes long).
5. The LLM evaluates the user's solution to this challenge.

## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this session, students should be able to:
1. Install Visual Studio Code
2. Understand the basic layout and features of VSCode
3. Configure VSCode for React and TypeScript development
4. Install and use essential extensions for Next.js development

## Content Chunks

### Chunk 1: Introduction to Visual Studio Code (30 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- What is Visual Studio Code?
- Why use VSCode for Next.js development?
- Key features of VSCode (IntelliSense, debugging, Git integration)

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. What are three key features of Visual Studio Code?
2. How does VSCode differ from a simple text editor?

#### Practical Task:
Guide the user through downloading and installing Visual Studio Code from the official website.

### Chunk 2: VSCode Interface and Basic Usage (45 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- VSCode interface layout (sidebar, editor, panels)
- Basic operations (opening files, creating folders, saving)
- Using the integrated terminal

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. Where can you find the file explorer in VSCode?
2. How do you open the integrated terminal?

#### Practical Task:
Ask the user to create a new folder, open it in VSCode, and create a new file named "index.js" using the VSCode interface.

### Chunk 3: Configuring VSCode for React and TypeScript (45 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Importance of proper configuration for React and TypeScript
- Configuring the TypeScript compiler
- Setting up linting and formatting

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. Why is it important to configure VSCode for React and TypeScript?
2. What is the purpose of linting in development?

#### Practical Task:
Guide the user through creating a `tsconfig.json` file with basic TypeScript compiler options.

### Chunk 4: Essential Extensions for Next.js Development (60 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- What are VSCode extensions?
- Essential extensions for Next.js development:
  - ESLint
  - Prettier
  - React Snippets
  - Next.js Snippets
  - GitLens

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. How do extensions enhance the VSCode experience?
2. What does the ESLint extension do?

#### Practical Task:
Ask the user to install the mentioned extensions and explore their features.

### Chunk 5: Customizing VSCode Settings (30 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Accessing VSCode settings
- Common settings to adjust (auto-save, tab size, theme)
- Creating workspace-specific settings

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. How do you access VSCode settings?
2. What's the difference between user settings and workspace settings?

#### Practical Task:
Guide the user through customizing some VSCode settings, such as enabling auto-save and changing the color theme.

## Extended Coding Challenge (30 minutes)

Create a basic TypeScript React component in VSCode, utilizing the installed extensions. The component should:
1. Be named "HelloWorld"
2. Accept a "name" prop of type string
3. Display "Hello, [name]!" where [name] is the value of the prop

Evaluation Criteria:
- Correct use of TypeScript for prop types
- Proper React component structure
- Utilization of VSCode features (e.g., IntelliSense, auto-formatting)

## Notes for LLM Instructor
- Be patient with users who are new to IDEs. Explain concepts thoroughly and use analogies where possible.
- Encourage exploration of VSCode features. Learning keyboard shortcuts can significantly boost productivity.
- If users encounter installation issues, guide them through troubleshooting steps.
- Emphasize the importance of a well-configured development environment for productivity and code quality.
- Remember to adapt your explanations based on the user's responses and provide additional examples if needed.

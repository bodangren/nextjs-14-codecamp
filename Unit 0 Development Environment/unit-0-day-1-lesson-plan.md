Help the student navigate through the project structure, opening and briefly explaining key files.

### Chunk 6: Running the Development Server and Making Simple Changes (30 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- How to start the Next.js development server
- Introduction to Fast Refresh

#### Comprehension Check Question:
What happens when we make changes to our code while the development server is running?

#### Practical Task:
1. Guide the student to start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
2. Help them make a simple change to the main page content in `app/page.tsx`
3. Observe the changes in the browser

## Extended Coding Challenge (30 minutes)

Modify the main page of the Personal Blog Application:
1. Open `app/page.tsx`
2. Change the content to display "Welcome to [Your Name]'s Blog"
3. Add a brief description of what the blog will be about
4. Save the changes and verify them in the browser

Evaluation Criteria:
- Successful modification of the main page
- Effective use of VSCode features (e.g., auto-formatting)
- Successful rendering of the welcome message and description

## Notes for LLM Instructor
- Emphasize how each step contributes to setting up an efficient development environment for the Personal Blog Application.
- Encourage students to explore VSCode features, as they'll be using this tool throughout the course.
- Be prepared to troubleshoot common issues with Next.js project initialization.
- Use the context of building a blog to make abstract concepts more concrete and relatable.
- Remind students that this setup will serve as the foundation for their project throughout the course.
- Adapt explanations based on the student's familiarity with development environments and provide additional examples if needed.
- Avoid introducing concepts from later units (like TypeScript specifics or React components).
- Ensure all steps are clear and achievable for beginners with no prior experience in web development.

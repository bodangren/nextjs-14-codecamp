# Unit 0: Development Environment Setup for Personal Blog Application

## Overview
This unit focuses on setting up a robust development environment for the Personal Blog Application project using Next.js 14 with React, TypeScript, and GCP development. Students will configure their environment, learn version control basics, and initialize the project.

## Learning Objectives
- Set up and customize Visual Studio Code for efficient React and TypeScript development
- Understand and implement version control using Git and GitHub
- Install and configure Node.js and npm for Next.js development
- Initialize the Personal Blog Application project with Next.js and TypeScript

## Project Context
The Personal Blog Application will be the first major project of the course. In this unit, students will set up the foundation for this project, creating the initial structure and repository.

## Daily Breakdown

### Day 1: VSCode Setup and Project Initialization
- Main concepts to cover:
  - Installing and configuring Visual Studio Code
  - Essential extensions for Next.js, React, and TypeScript development
  - Creating a new Next.js project with TypeScript for the Personal Blog Application
- Practical tasks:
  - Install VSCode and configure it for web development
  - Install key extensions (ESLint, Prettier, React/Redux snippets, etc.)
  - Initialize a new Next.js project with TypeScript for the Personal Blog Application
  - Create a simple "Hello, World!" page in the project
- Comprehension check questions:
  - What are the benefits of using VSCode for Next.js development?
  - How does TypeScript integration benefit our Personal Blog project?

### Day 2: Git and GitHub Basics
- Main concepts to cover:
  - Introduction to version control and its importance in project development
  - Basic Git commands (init, add, commit, push, pull)
  - Creating and managing repositories on GitHub
- Practical tasks:
  - Initialize the Personal Blog Application as a Git repository
  - Create a .gitignore file appropriate for a Next.js project
  - Make initial commits with the project setup
  - Create a GitHub repository for the Personal Blog Application
  - Push the local repository to GitHub
- Comprehension check questions:
  - How does version control benefit our Personal Blog project development?
  - What's the difference between Git and GitHub in our workflow?

### Day 3: Node.js, npm, and Project Configuration
- Main concepts to cover:
  - Installing and managing Node.js and npm
  - Understanding package.json and node_modules in the context of our project
  - Configuring the Personal Blog Application project
- Practical tasks:
  - Ensure Node.js and npm are correctly installed
  - Explore and modify the package.json file for the Personal Blog Application
  - Add custom npm scripts for development workflows
  - Create a README.md file explaining the Personal Blog Application setup
  - Set up a basic folder structure for the blog (e.g., components, pages, styles)
- Comprehension check questions:
  - What role does package.json play in our Personal Blog Application?
  - How can custom npm scripts improve our development workflow?

## Unit Challenge: Personal Blog Application Setup
Finalize the setup of the Personal Blog Application project. The project should include:
- A fully configured Next.js application with TypeScript
- A customized VSCode workspace with necessary extensions
- A Git repository with an appropriate .gitignore file
- A GitHub repository with the initial project pushed
- A README.md file explaining the project setup and how to run it
- A basic folder structure for a blog application
- At least one custom npm script to improve the development workflow

Evaluation criteria:
- Correct Next.js project structure with TypeScript configuration
- Proper Git setup with meaningful initial commits
- Clear and informative README.md with setup instructions
- Functional custom npm script(s)
- Successful push of the project to GitHub

## Notes for LLM Instructor
- Emphasize how each setup step contributes to the development of the Personal Blog Application.
- Use the blog project context to make abstract concepts more concrete (e.g., explaining commits as saving progress on blog features).
- Guide students through potential installation issues, especially with Node.js on different operating systems.
- Encourage students to start thinking about the structure of their blog as they set up folders and files.
- Remember to frequently check understanding and provide additional examples related to blog development if needed.
- Be prepared to explain how this setup will benefit the students throughout the course and in real-world development scenarios.

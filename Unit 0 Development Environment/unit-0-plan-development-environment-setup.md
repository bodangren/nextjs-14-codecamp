# Course Structure Guidelines

This course is delivered by an AI Language Model (LLM) with the following structure:

1. Each day's session lasts approximately 3-4 hours.
2. The LLM breaks down topics into small, manageable chunks.
3. For each chunk:
   a. The LLM presents the information.
   b. Comprehension-check questions are asked to ensure understanding.
   c. The LLM corrects any misunderstandings.
   d. Where relevant, short code submissions are requested from the user.
   e. The LLM provides guidance to improve the user's code.
4. Once per topic, there's a more extensive coding/implementation challenge (about 30 minutes long).
5. The LLM evaluates the user's solution to this challenge.

The format is highly interactive, with constant checks for understanding and practical application of knowledge. The LLM can adjust its teaching based on the user's responses and performance.

# Unit 0: Development Environment Setup

## Overview
This unit focuses on setting up a robust development environment for Next.js 14 with React, TypeScript, and GCP development. A properly configured environment is crucial for efficient coding, debugging, and collaboration throughout the course and in real-world projects.

## Learning Objectives
- Set up and customize Visual Studio Code for efficient React and TypeScript development
- Understand and implement version control using Git and GitHub
- Install and configure Node.js and npm for Next.js development
- Initialize a basic Next.js project with TypeScript

## Key Topics
- Visual Studio Code setup and essential extensions
- Git and GitHub basics
- Node.js and npm fundamentals
- Next.js project initialization

## Daily Breakdown

### Day 1: VSCode Setup
- Main concepts to cover:
  - Installing Visual Studio Code
  - Configuring VSCode for React and TypeScript development
  - Essential extensions for Next.js development
- Suggested comprehension check questions:
  - What are the benefits of using VSCode for Next.js development?
  - Which extensions are crucial for React and TypeScript development?
- Short coding tasks ideas:
  - Create a simple TypeScript file and observe VSCode's autocompletion and type checking
- Resources or references:
  - Visual Studio Code official documentation
  - React and TypeScript extension recommendations

### Day 2: Git and GitHub Basics
- Main concepts to cover:
  - Introduction to version control and its importance
  - Basic Git commands (init, add, commit, push, pull)
  - Creating and managing repositories on GitHub
- Suggested comprehension check questions:
  - What is the purpose of version control in software development?
  - How does Git differ from GitHub?
- Short coding tasks ideas:
  - Initialize a local Git repository and push it to GitHub
- Resources or references:
  - Git documentation
  - GitHub Guides

### Day 3: Node.js, npm, and Project Initialization
- Main concepts to cover:
  - Installing Node.js and npm
  - Understanding package.json and node_modules
  - Initializing a Next.js project with TypeScript
- Suggested comprehension check questions:
  - What is the role of package.json in a Node.js project?
  - How does TypeScript integration benefit a Next.js project?
- Short coding tasks ideas:
  - Initialize a new Next.js project with TypeScript support
- Resources or references:
  - Node.js and npm documentation
  - Next.js documentation on getting started with TypeScript

## Unit Challenge
Create a new Next.js project with TypeScript, initialize it as a Git repository, and push it to a new GitHub repository. The project should include:
- A customized VSCode workspace
- A .gitignore file appropriate for a Next.js project
- A README.md file explaining the project setup
- At least one custom npm script in package.json

Evaluation criteria:
- Correct project structure
- Proper TypeScript configuration
- Successful push to GitHub
- Clear and informative README.md

## Notes for LLM Instructor
- Students may struggle with Git concepts initially. Use analogies like "saving a game progress" to explain commits and branches.
- Emphasize the importance of consistent coding environments across team members.
- Guide students through potential installation issues, especially with Node.js on different operating systems.
- Encourage students to explore VSCode features and customize their setup to boost productivity.
- Remember to break down information into small chunks and frequently check for understanding, as per the course structure.
- Be prepared to adapt explanations based on the user's responses and provide additional examples if needed.

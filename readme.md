# Next.js 14 with React, TypeScript, and GCP Development Camp

Welcome to this AI-assisted course on Next.js 14, React, TypeScript, and Google Cloud Platform development. This course is designed to be interactive, with an AI Language Model (LLM) as your instructor. The recommended LLM is currently (2024-06-25) claude.ai Sonnet 3.5 because it is the most accurate on this topic, but other LLMs may work.

## How to Use This Course

1. **Review the Syllabus**: Start by reviewing the `syllabus.md` file to understand the course structure and content.

2. **Daily Learning**: For each day of the course:
   - Locate the unit plan for the current day in the appropriate unit folder.
   - Find the corresponding lesson plan for the day.

3. **Set Up Your Learning Environment**:
   - Open a new chat with an AI Language Model (like ChatGPT or Claude).
   - Copy and paste the following into the chat:
     - The course syllabus
     - The unit plan for the current day
     - The day's lesson plan

4. **Start the Lesson**: Begin by telling the LLM: "I'm ready to start today's lesson. Please begin with the first chunk of content."

5. **Interactive Learning**: 
   - The LLM will present information in chunks, ask comprehension questions, and give you practical tasks.
   - Engage with the LLM by answering questions and completing the tasks.
   - Ask for clarification or additional examples if needed.

6. **Complete the Coding Challenge**: At the end of each lesson, there will be an extended coding challenge. Complete this challenge and share your code with the LLM for feedback.

7. **Review and Reflect**: At the end of each day, review what you've learned and reflect on how it fits into the bigger picture of web development.

## General Prompt for the LLM

When starting each day's lesson, you can use the following prompt with the LLM:

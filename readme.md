# Next.js 14 with React, TypeScript, and GCP Development Camp

Welcome to this AI-assisted course on Next.js 14, React, TypeScript, and Google Cloud Platform development. This course is designed to be interactive, with an AI Language Model (LLM) as your instructor. The recommended LLM is currently (2024-06-25) claude.ai Sonnet 3.5 because it is the most accurate on this topic, but other LLMs may work.

## How to Use This Course

1. **Review the Syllabus**: Start by reviewing the `syllabus.md` file to understand the course structure and content.

2. **Set Up Your Learning Environment**:
   - Open a new chat with an AI Language Model (like ChatGPT or Claude).
   - If you're using Claude, take advantage of the new projects feature or custom GPTs to organize all files for one unit together. This will help maintain context throughout your learning session.

3. **Daily Learning**: For each day of the course:
   - Locate the unit plan for the current day in the appropriate unit folder.
   - Find the corresponding lesson plan for the day.
   - Copy and paste the following into your chat:
     - The course syllabus
     - The unit plan for the current day
     - The day's lesson plan

4. **Start the Lesson**: Begin by telling the LLM: "I'm ready to start today's lesson. Please begin with the first chunk of content."

5. **Interactive Learning**: 
   - The LLM will present information in chunks, ask comprehension questions, and give you practical tasks.
   - Engage with the LLM by answering questions and completing the tasks.
   - Ask for clarification or additional examples if needed.

6. **Complete the Coding Challenge**: At the end of each lesson, there will be an extended coding challenge. Complete this challenge and share your code with the LLM for feedback.

7. **Review and Reflect**: At the end of each day, review what you've learned and reflect on how it fits into the bigger picture of web development.

## General Prompt for the LLM

When starting each day's lesson, you can use the following prompt with the LLM:

```
I'm a student in the Next.js 14 with React, TypeScript, and GCP Development Camp. I've provided the course syllabus, the unit plan for today, and today's lesson plan. Please act as my instructor for today's lesson, following these guidelines:

1. Present the information in small, manageable chunks.
2. After each chunk, ask me comprehension check questions.
3. Provide coding tasks and challenges as outlined in the lesson plan.
4. Offer feedback on my code and help me improve it.
5. Adapt your teaching based on my responses and questions.
6. At the end of the lesson, guide me through the extended coding challenge.

Please start with an introduction to today's topic and the first chunk of content.
```

## Tips for Success

- Engage actively with the LLM by asking questions and seeking clarification.
- Complete all practical tasks and coding challenges.
- Try to apply what you learn to real-world scenarios or personal projects.
- Review previous days' content regularly to reinforce your learning.
- Don't hesitate to ask the LLM to explain concepts in different ways if you're struggling.

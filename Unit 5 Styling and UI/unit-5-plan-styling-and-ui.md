## Unit Challenge
Build a "Responsive Next.js 14 E-commerce UI" that showcases the styling and UI techniques learned in this unit. The application should include:

- A responsive layout that works on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Use of CSS Modules for component-specific styles
- Extensive use of Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
- A dark mode toggle implemented with Tailwind CSS

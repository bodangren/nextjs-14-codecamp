### Chunk 2: Implementing Responsive Design with CSS Modules (60 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Creating responsive layouts with CSS Grid and Flexbox in CSS Modules
- Implementing media queries in CSS Modules
- Responsive typography and imagery techniques
- Managing breakpoints effectively in CSS Modules

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. How can you implement a responsive grid system using CSS Modules?
2. What strategies can be employed to manage breakpoints effectively in a CSS Modules setup?

#### Practical Task:
Ask the user to create a responsive component (e.g., a product card) using CSS Modules, ensuring it adapts well to different screen sizes.

### Chunk 3: Responsive Design with Tailwind CSS (60 minutes)

#### Information to Present:

- Creating complex responsive layouts with Tailwind
- Tailwind's container queries and their use cases

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. How does Tailwind CSS's approach to responsive design differ from traditional media queries?
2. In what scenarios would you use Tailwind's container queries over standard responsive utilities?

#### Practical Task:
Guide the user through recreating the responsive component from the previous task using Tailwind CSS, comparing and contrasting the two approaches.

### Chunk 4: Advanced Responsive Design Patterns and Optimization (45 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Implementing advanced responsive patterns (e.g., off-canvas navigation, responsive data tables)
- Optimizing responsive images in Next.js 14
- Performance considerations for responsive designs
- Accessibility in responsive design

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. How can you optimize images for responsive designs in Next.js 14?
2. What are some key accessibility considerations when implementing responsive designs?

#### Practical Task:
Ask the user to implement an advanced responsive pattern (e.g., a responsive data table) using both CSS Modules and Tailwind CSS, with a focus on performance and accessibility.

## Extended Coding Challenge (90 minutes)

Create a "Next.js 14 Responsive Dashboard" that showcases responsive design techniques using both CSS Modules and Tailwind CSS. The dashboard should include:

1. A responsive navigation bar with a mobile-friendly off-canvas menu
2. A grid of widgets that rearrange based on screen size
3. A responsive data table with a mobile-friendly alternative view
4. A form with inputs that adapt to different screen sizes
5. Responsive charts or graphs (you can use a charting library compatible with Next.js)
6. A footer with a responsive layout

The project should demonstrate:
- Effective use of both CSS Modules and Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- Implementation of advanced responsive design patterns
- Consideration of performance in responsive designs
- Accessibility in responsive layouts
- Consistent design across various device sizes

Evaluation Criteria:
- Correct implementation of responsive design principles
- Effective use of both CSS Modules and Tailwind CSS for responsive layouts
- Successful implementation of advanced responsive patterns
- Performance optimization for responsive elements (especially images and layout shifts)

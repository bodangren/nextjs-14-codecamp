## Content Chunks

### Chunk 1: Customizing Tailwind CSS (60 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Deep dive into tailwind.config.js
- Extending and overriding Tailwind's default theme
- Creating custom utility classes
- Using Tailwind's functions and directives (@apply, @layer, etc.)

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. How can you extend Tailwind's color palette with your own custom colors?
2. What is the purpose of the @apply directive in Tailwind CSS?

#### Practical Task:

### Chunk 2: Advanced Tailwind CSS Features (45 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Understanding and using Tailwind variants
- Creating custom variants
- Working with Tailwind plugins
- Using Tailwind's JIT (Just-In-Time) mode in Next.js 14

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. What are Tailwind variants and how do they enhance the utility-first approach?
2. How does Tailwind's JIT mode improve the development experience in Next.js 14?

#### Practical Task:
Ask the user to implement a custom variant for a specific interaction (e.g., 'group-focus') and use it in a component. Also, guide them through enabling and using JIT mode in their Next.js 14 project.

### Chunk 3: Complex Layouts and Components with Tailwind CSS (60 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Building responsive grid layouts with Tailwind
- Creating complex UI components (e.g., dropdown menus, modals)
- Implementing animations and transitions with Tailwind
- Strategies for maintaining larger Tailwind projects

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. How can you create a responsive grid layout using Tailwind CSS?
2. What strategies can be employed to keep Tailwind CSS code organized in larger projects?

#### Practical Task:
Guide the user through creating a complex UI component (e.g., a responsive navbar with dropdown menus) using Tailwind CSS in their Next.js 14 project.

### Chunk 4: Integrating Tailwind with CSS-in-JS (30 minutes)

#### Information to Present:
- Overview of CSS-in-JS solutions compatible with Next.js 14
- Integrating Tailwind with styled-components or Emotion
- Using Tailwind classes within CSS-in-JS
- Pros and cons of combining Tailwind with CSS-in-JS

#### Comprehension Check Questions:
1. How can Tailwind CSS be integrated with a CSS-in-JS solution like styled-components?
2. What are the advantages and potential drawbacks of combining Tailwind with CSS-in-JS?

#### Practical Task:
Ask the user to integrate a CSS-in-JS solution (e.g., styled-components) with Tailwind CSS in their Next.js 14 project and create a styled component using both approaches.

## Extended Coding Challenge (90 minutes)

Enhance the "Next.js 14 Portfolio Page with Tailwind CSS" from Day 43 to include advanced Tailwind CSS features and customizations. The enhanced project should include:

1. A custom color scheme and extended theme
2. Custom utility classes for common patterns in your design
3. A complex UI component (e.g., an image carousel or tabbed interface) built with Tailwind
4. Usage of Tailwind's JIT mode for improved development experience
5. Integration with a CSS-in-JS solution for a specific component
6. Animations and transitions using Tailwind's utilities

The project should demonstrate:
- Advanced customization of Tailwind CSS
- Effective use of Tailwind's advanced features (variants, plugins, JIT mode)
- Creation of complex, responsive layouts and components
- Integration of Tailwind with other styling solutions
- Optimization of Tailwind CSS for production

Evaluation Criteria:

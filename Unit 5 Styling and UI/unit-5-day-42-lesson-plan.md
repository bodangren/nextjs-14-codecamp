#### Practical Task:
Ask the user to implement a basic theming system with dark mode support using CSS Modules in their Next.js 14 project.

## Extended Coding Challenge (90 minutes)

Enhance the "Next.js 14 Blog Layout with CSS Modules" from Day 41 to include advanced CSS Modules techniques. The enhanced project should include:

1. A responsive design using CSS Modules and media queries
2. A theming system with light and dark mode support
3. TypeScript integration with typed CSS Modules
4. Performance optimizations including PurgeCSS setup
5. Advanced CSS techniques like mixins and custom properties
6. Accessible color schemes and contrast ratios

The project should demonstrate:
- Advanced usage of CSS Modules for complex styling scenarios
- Effective integration of CSS Modules with TypeScript
- Implementation of a flexible theming system
- Performance optimizations for CSS in a Next.js 14 application
- Adherence to accessibility standards in styling

Evaluation Criteria:
- Correct implementation of advanced CSS Modules techniques
- Effective use of TypeScript with CSS Modules
- Successful implementation of a theming system with dark mode
- Optimized CSS output and setup of PurgeCSS
- Responsive and accessible design
- Clean, efficient, and well-organized code structure
